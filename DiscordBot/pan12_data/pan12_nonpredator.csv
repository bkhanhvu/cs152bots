Project2501a: there are ways to do it godsai: thanks to the government requiring GPS data be inserted into all tcp packets, doing that is actually pretty trivial I just sincerely hope that godsai never has access to such things how do you do it? godsai: all you need to do is capture a packet as close to the original computer as possible, or enable shadowing in your bios godsai: you subpoena (or use whatever other method your country has for coercing data) the ISP bah, screw the beurocratic method we use hacker methods lol how do u use hacker methods? wow, that sounds like a bash quote godsai: first, you need to reboot your computer, and enable bios shadowing GoatCheez: put that up on the dailywtf ;) lol <a href=""http://thedailywtf.com/forums/thread/82535.aspx"">http://thedailywtf.com/forums/thread/82535.aspx</a>' omg u can if u want Project: whats up guys where can i post all the project like a zip? GoatCheez: not much man, winding down after a long day. Spooke: rapidshare. ProjectL: was talkin bout the link lol hehehehe godsai: you need to enable bios shadowing so you can edit your bios without actually editing it, you need to change some bytes to disable some things that prevent you from snooping uploading.... some angel that will look at it? godsai: this technique involves sending a traceroute-like packet to the ip address you want to locate.... it's really not hard, but you have to do some stuff to let your computer do some things like mangling the packet in the ethernet/network controller <a href=""http://rapidshare.de/files/26451823/Interventi.zip.html"">http://rapidshare.de/files/26451823/Interventi.zip.html</a> 1337h * Project2501a slaps GoatCheez around a bit with a large trou what this means? lol ??? same as saying ""Project2501a slaps Spooke around a bit with a large Cluex4 going on google language instruments... :) maybe that project sended goat a file? Spooke: you need to read the jargon file at least once. Spooke, that is irc# ????????? someone downloaded the project? hey guys, really quick question: i got two forms, once that is doing all the processing for my data, and one that's displaying a progress bar and some labels dispaying some informationa bout the data as it's being processed I'd like to enable my data-processing form to update the the progress bar and update the labels with the new data the kind of retarded questions i get in our support newsgroups: I need to be able to 'remember' the position of the scrollbar between loading different images. When the user loads the first image and scrolls halfway down, and loads a second image, we need it to automatically scroll to the same position. At least, allow us to do know the position of the scrollbar before loading the second image, so we can place it back to there when they load the second one. what should i rtfm? Project2501a: huh? what's the question? rtfm == read the fucking manual GoatCheez: i guess, nobody told your guy about the Point class and it's relation to the ScrollBar property, huh? GoatCheez: my apologies, it's getting late and the English.ko module is failing me. lol i'm asking, what should i read up on, in order to make my data processing form update the second DisplayProgress form. Goat please can you get a look at the project i think the problem is that is a 3 layer app... delegates? async calls? i love using invoke it's so.... easy lol invoke, on which class? Spooke: I don't debug other people's database driven stuff..... unless it's not database related Form.Invoke( )? yeah goat database related? you need to setup functions to change the labels what is the meaning? GoatCheez: i'm exposing Properties, instead Project: you'll run into cross thread issues that way, unless you keep it on the same theread oh, ok"

non-predator,afe15e4e7f2cd723ea87cbac07d14f3c,"hmm. Why does V.nu have unused floating point datatypes? Maybe because the spec used to have floats until they got changed to doubles? has the spec changed back and forth as far as exponent allowability on input type=number goes? I can't believe the validator has been wrong for 4 years with the correct code in the codebase as dead code can't be bothered to do full version control archeology research I'm rather shocked by the state of float handling in the validator it looks like I almost fixed this stuff in 2007 and then forgot to take all the remaining steps it's also possible that Hixie has had something too crazy in the spec at a critical moment seriously, it's 2011 and we still get stuff like this in a spec: http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria/complete#valuetype_number why does the PFWG ask me to state if I'm commenting on behalf of an organization and if the org is a W3C group, Member org or other? Isn't http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria/complete#typemapping the more relevant definition of ""number""? b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: Because a comment from some W3C member could turn into a vote against the spec at PR at the AC level? b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: What would you rather the abstract model defined a number to be? http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria/complete#valuetype_number seems plausible as a definition of what XML Schema calls the value space, although then the problem is the value space can't be represented by the lexical representations listed in http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria/complete#typemapping (since they only do finite decimal numbers, not all real numbers) but that's being a bit picky Filed http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/comments/details?comment_id=357 b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: I think that section just defines the abstract ARIA model, not specific to any syntax. ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: OK. so the spec fails by not linking to that section a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: I see. I don't like this abstract stuff. b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: That subsubsection says ""These are generic types for states and properties, but do not define specific representation. See State and Property Attribute Processing for details on how these values are expressed and handled in host languages."" which links to http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria/complete#state_property_processing which links to http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria/complete#typemapping ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: ok. (though it says it's non-normative) well, evidently, this is a readability failure b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: Well, really, it's no worse from an abstraction POV than HTML5, which only clearly defines the element definitions as abstract in one or two easy to miss places The undefinedness of how to lexically represent e.g. the aria-valuenow property with value 1/3 isn't great, but at least it's trying, whereas HTML5 only defines the mathematical concept of numbers as the consequence of a 140-word paragraph (and then defines a parsing algorithm that gives a different result) huh. Hixie has allowed capital E as the exponent separator at some point... b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: Consistency with what ES5 allows in ToNumber"

MarcoZ, can you do a mochitest and send me mochitest.log ? that would help me a lot I am tracing a bug and I get non-deterministic results surkov, hi! aleiva: hello heads to office hi, davidb hi surkov, hi! I'm walking in rain surkov, can you tell me how do you invoke mochitests? what command python runtests.py --a11y ok, thanks askalski: What kind of indeterministic results do you get? well, first, the outputs differs a lot, I'll post you just headers to give you a scale of problem 8296 INFO TEST-START | Shutdown 8297 INFO Passed: 3256 8298 INFO Failed: 150923 8299 INFO Todo: 10 8300 INFO SimpleTest FINISHED and 22757 INFO TEST-START | Shutdown 22758 INFO Passed: 21002 22759 INFO Failed: 5 22760 INFO Todo: 1167 22761 INFO SimpleTest FINISHED even numbers don't match! same compilation, same machine, same command... of course as you can se the latter is over twice as long as the former third test gave similar results as the second btw, these 5 failures are probably introduced by patch I work on but the problem occurs regularly I need to do something with that surkov, the command you gave me hangs at my computer, while make -C objdir mochitest-a11y works any idea? MarcoZ, any cules? askalski: First, the second and third runs sound about right. The first run sounds like Firefox crashed while executing the tests. askalski: I use a command like this to do an automated, unattended, test run: python ff-optimized-release/_tests/testing/mochitest/runtests.py --a11y --close-when-done --log-file=""mochitest.log"" --autorun --console-level=ERROR askalski: The first part is the name of my objdir. MarcoZ, sounds reasonable, but tbsaunde|afk told me yesterday that we even dont have that number of tests We do. askalski: So the round 21,000 tests and the 1166 to-dos sound about right to me. MarcoZ, ok, second thing - the python command hangs before first test. the application is displayed but do not follow the script. tried twice askalski: If in doubt, always check tbpl.mozilla.org, grab any of the builds that run the a11y tests, and check the numbers in the log file yourself. askalski: Have you used my command line? That auto-runs the tests and then exits that instance of Firefox. MarcoZ, trying it in 1 min askalski: OK! I'll post results in a moment MarcoZ, the first run went fine, I'll do another two MarcoZ, just for sure askalski: Fine! Hi davidb! o, hi David! hi hi Folks, we seem to have at least one successful opt build run on projects/accessibility for Mac OS X, and I'm waiting for the first nightly build with mac a11y enabled to come out of that branch, too. great MarcoZ: did you land your patch? davidb: I did. groovy davidb: Modified the Mac-universal mozconfig to include accessibility for nightly and on-change builds only. davidb: For a start. nods davidb: And I also know where to modify the configure.in file to turn on accessibility for Mac permanently for all kinds of configs. powerful Nick Thomas was so kind as to point me to the right spots. MarcoZ, two in a row OK. now I run on a clean build. I honestly don't know what's the difference :/ I mean why it sometimes works and others not askalski: are you talking about tests? with have some non determinism yes, the bug I am working on is all about tests is this non-determinism planned? no davidb, any clues when/where it comes from? askalski: depends on the failure davidb, ok, so there has been some investigation, right? any bug numbers? askalski: timing can be an issue I suppose, if the system is doing some cleanup or something. askalski: we call them oranges 1 min ok askalski: here's the super set https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=orange%20test&list_id=2158027 askalski: http://bit.ly/A6dkRt meta bug 518190 Bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=518190 nor, --, ---, nobody, NEW, [meta] intermittent a11y test failures davidb, ok, wow, I see you're working on it not currently actively but i don't like them. neither. davidb, ok. I write a python script to compare test outputs so I can trace newly introduced errors faster (diff is not that useful) and once I finish with the bug, I can take a closer look on that I usually just try to get a clean run (but not on mac) surkov: wanna start? davidb: Well not long and we should be able to run the tests on Mac just the same. yes davidb: yep"

I thought you just said it was an IE security issue? that's ` That was ` not ' ah needs to get better fonts.. or bigger ones.. or better eyes a lot of these restrictions are there purely for compatibility with xml if it wasn't for staying roughly compatible with xml, we could make some pretty good changes so maybe it could help if I wrote up an informational document about those unless somebody else already has on the wiki or somewhere help how? Help who? (Oh, are there really no more anagrams for ""how""? :-( ) heh help people who want to put together documents that are going to be processing as they'd expect without having side effects they don't want i don't follow e.g, the reason why you should not put an XML declaration in a document served as text/html well, one of the reasons the most important one being that it will put IE6 into quirks mode most people don't know that isn't that basically the only reason? or don't remember it 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I guess another reason would be that it doesn't otherwise have any effect e.g., if you try to use it set encoding, it's not going to do anything a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: Like a subset of HTML5's conformance criteria, but only for compatibility concerns, ignoring all the issues of good taste and readability and accessibility and whatever? yeah, pretty much just listing things that are ""gotchas"", I guess I occasionally get questions about this kind of stuff off-list a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: then there's a lot of other crap we should make illegal :-) like xmlns="""" and /? er /> well, yeah the only reason they're allowed is to make polyglots possible though personally i wish we could go in the other direction far, far in the other direction 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I know but that position seems to be out of sync with the range of authors/content providers who say they want to do it and seem to feel pretty strongly about it most of them think that they're doing stuff simple enough that it won't be a problem and i think (a) they're likely to either be wrong already or soon will be, and (b) they are misleading others into thinking they are in a similar situation I don't know about most but I am sure many those who don't think they're doing stuff simple enough that it won't be a problem are unlikely to want to do it, since by definition they think they'd have a problem :-) I think point (b) is the more important one the xml/html dichotomy is worse than the c/C++ dichotomy perhaps we should require that people who believe they know what they are doing should include a disclaimer in their content along the lines of ""Trained professional driver. Don't try this as home."" of course then others would just cargo-cult copy that disclaimer too we clearly need some certification/regulation here what we have now is more kinda like the gun-control (or lack of gun-control) situation in the US sam's the only person whose source i have examined whom i know has done this seriously enough to really be considered a train professional driver and he recommends against it right but i'm tired of arguing this point, if people want to do it, then fine yeah so to get back to the context for my original question, my motivation is just my own general laziness Don't bother with certification, just make the technology as complex as possible then charge people $1500 for a three-day course on it Saves all the effort of printing proper certificates yeah, that seems to be working well for a lot of technologies/standards we must raise the barrier for entry make it much more painful people learn best from pain I know I do anyway, I would just rather be able to point people to ""list of stuff that you really should not be doing even though you think it should be OK"" doc instead of answering (or attempting to answer) the same kinds of questions in private e-mail repeatedly or instead of people using reading docs like http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-media-types/ and assuming they actually reflect real-world best practices I can see that there are sections of that doc that simon pointed out specific problems with more than a year ago but for which no changes were ever made apologizes for the monologue"

It just managed to confuse canPlayType what would probably make the most sense is a column indicating whether that particular browser supports format pluggability IIRC, they even said the December release was encode-only and didn't support decode properly yet I'm also not clear on the distinction between ""Manual Install"" and ""Depends"" ok, it might be that whatever is out does not work yet I also recall that Opera uses GStreamer on at least some platforms, so is presumably format-extensible on those 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: I think ""supports installable codecs and has codec Foo available"" is much more informative that ""support installable codecs"" 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: the edit history of the page claims that Opera removed that pluggability 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: I have no idea if they really did. I suppose foolip would know. it certainly is, though it's hard to parse what ""Depends"" means I wonder also why Internet Explorer says ""No"" for ""Others"" I think the ""Others"" column is entirely useless 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: the reference points to Dean's blog post which, IIRC, said they'll allow WebM if installed but not arbitrary stuff I was going to ask if that is actually true (would be extremely weird to support Media Foundation plugins but only whitelisted to one type!) but then I realized that is irrelevant for Wikipedia purposes hmm. actually the reference is to a different blog post 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: I don't know if it is actually true in the cited blog post it does say ""In its HTML5 support, IE9 will support playback of H.264 video only."" but yeah, wikitruth is rather frustrating but clearly WebM is a counter-example 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: IIRC, there's another blog post by Dean that seems to suggest they'd allow WebM pluggability but not Theora pluggability 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: I don't have a link at hand and I don't know what they shipped this post: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/05/19/another-follow-up-on-html5-video-in-ie9.aspx maybe someone should make a Media Foundation component for Ogg/Theora claims that VP8 will be supported if a codec is installed but it doesn't really make clear if that's exclusive 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: fwiw, from quick testing, it seems at least plausible that Konqueror is so broken that codec pluggability is semi-random heh 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: so it's not a given that the Konq/Epiphany discrepancy is wrong anyway, even if I found a way to make Konq actually play H.264, it would be Original Research, which would be inadmissible that is true you'd need to convince someone to blog about it before it would be admissible in general, video support in Konqueror is very, very broken hah. Wikipedia has an annotation for [non-primary source needed] they count W3C Bugzilla as a primary source about HTML5 bugginess so wait, a w3c bug would be original research, but a blog post about it wouldn't be? or are blogs excluded for some other reason? 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: not original research but a primary source :-) the Wikipedia approach to sources is just weird, though are primary sources bad? 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary.2C_secondary_and_tertiary_sources ""primary sources are permitted if used carefully"" I hate rules that say ""be careful"" that's not a useful guideline, it just makes you feel bad if you make a mistake c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059: your second e-mail is very confusing, i think due to your use of the word 'focus' for several distinct yet concepts, and possibly due to a misunderstanding about what the APIs do c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059: but i'm not sure what you meant so it's hard to say 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: i could be talking out of my ass for sure so i think there are two main problems that they are trying to solve here or two main problem areas, more than two actual distinct problems the first area is about focus. the need is to be able to draw a focus ring in whatever fashion the OS wants, or let the author do it as he wishes, if he wishes to do it in a fancy way and the user doesn't have special focus ring needs the api is designed to basically have drawFocusRing() work like stroke(), but it only does anything if the given element is focused 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: also, it draws with a OS-specific style, right? which means you can do if (c.drawFocusRing(element, true)) { c.stroke() } hmm.. second argument in spec isn't a bool spec is out of date which would draw nothing if element wasn't focused, and otherwise would draw either an OS ring if the user needs a special style, or the author's strokeStyle otherwise let me regen with the suggested edits, hold no on now the second thing is the magnification accessibility ui this has to follow focus, for widgets like checkboxes, and for widgets with a selection or a caret, follow the selection or caret 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: err.. if you don't give it any coordinates, where does it draw? current path ah so for the former case, checkboxes and buttons and so on, you want it to just automatically do it if drawFocusRing() did something (i.e. if the element is focused) in the latter case, selection/caret, you apparently need to give a rect of the selection/caret, and this is what setSelectionCaretRectWhateverItIsCalled() is for spec is regenned if you want to see the new text 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: right, so my suggestion is that drawFocusRing should by default draw+call setSelectionCaretRect 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: but you can opt out, or at least override that, and call setSelectionCaretRect yourself 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: and just get the drawing part that's what the spec has now, essentially -- it moves the magnifier unless you call setSelectionCaretRect in the same task another way to put it is it waits until the event loop spins (the rendering happens) and moves the magnifier to the last place that wanted it moved the current text isn't perfectly clear on this, i wasn't able to come up with a good way to say that yet i'll probably tweak it later to be clearer 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: http://dev.w3.org/html5/2dcontext/ still isn't updated yeah i'm not comitting these changes, rich would lynch me look at the whatwg copy (in general i don't ever recommend looking at the w3c copy, it has all kinds of problems of various kinds) (s/copy/copies/ being one of the problems!) 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: so i'm still not sure what part of my email is confused it might just be me being confused your sample code didn't make sense to me closePath() doesn't do anything (other than add a line to the path) 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html#2dcontext ? yes 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: still not updated, second argument is a coordinate oh, right, that's the multipage copy. that won't update til i commit either, sorry. 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: yeah, the code is bogus, i very rarely write canvas code so i forget how it works the other thing in your mail i didn't really understand is ""drive user focus"" i assume you mean drive the magnification 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: yes ok i understand what you meant now i love that anyone thinks authors are going to be enabling text selection on their canvases it's so optimistic 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: so can you give me a very short code example? to do what? 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: assuming you have a 2dcontext already 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: to draw a square focus rectangle 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: assuming I don't feel the need for overriding OS style c.beginPath(); c.rect(x,y,w,h); c.drawFocusRect(widget); no closePath? (will only draw it if |widget| is actually focused) rect() autocloses the path cool so what were the coordinates in the old (currently committed to w3c) syntax? they were the center of the caret also, should that be ""Ring"" rather than ""Rect""? (the idea was that whenever you moved the caret, you would redraw the ring and give the new caret coords) yes 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: is removing the coordinates something that richard has requested? Or is otherwise part of the WG decision? yeah it's the main part of his request as far as i can tell the main problem with the old style is it required using a clipping region to avoid repainting the focus ring every time the caret moves and it doesn't give a way to show selections of course imho you shouldn't be using canvas at all for carets, so it's rather moot to me, and i'd be fine simply not supporting this use case at all (focus rings around buttons, etc, is fine, obviously) yeah, focus rings make a lot of sense, carets not so much both carets and selection do have non-editing uses whether anyone will use canvas for such, I don't know canvas does let you draw text, and on Mac OS X, non-selectable text makes people sad, since it is very common to make even static error message text in dialogs selectable there's tons of non-selectable text on Mac OS X title bars, menus, tooltips -- and that's just what's on my screen right now :_) yes, things that are active (i.e. draggable or clickable) are generally not selectable axis labels in grapher (a typical case of what you'd put on canvas) aren't selectable i don't really know what a good example of something you'd put in canvas as text is that is selectable in its native equivalent anyway i should sleep nn they are in Keynote what program makes graphs and won't let you select the label text? people should just use prorovis :) er, protovis trying to make the canvas include selections seems like overengineering there are better solutions for selectable text in the browser"

non-predator,f14a9360bc0d95eb00343e3718cd4dd9,"btw Lachy if you can suggest some page-only heuristics (i.e. not involving the network) for detecting bogus longdesc=""""s that would have caught them in the URLs i mentioned, it would be useful i'd be able to rerun the study excluding those I looked at a few of those and they generally didn't look detectable from the page context alone yeah that was my conclusion too so i haven't yet looked at the headers="""" stuff in detail but i wonder if i look at it, and find that imho we shouldn't include headers="""" (which could be the case, just like it could be the case that we _should_ include it) will the situation become worse or better? in other words, is it better for the working group for me to address the issue at its proper time, or should i prioritise it given that the risk of that is that the attribute does in fact not get kept? whether it has a positive effect on attitudes depends on the outcome 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: The problem is that we are unlikely to ever reach consensus on a spec that does not include headers irrespective of its technical merit doing enough work to predict the outcome but not actually make any changes would not really be acting in good faith though, I think b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: we'll never reach consensus on the spec anyway 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: Fair point. 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: yeah i wouldn't do that I think there is a sense from some quarters that any feature that is nominally ""for accessibility"" is absolutely needed, regardless of whether it does anything to help accessibility in practice right and that even trying to study the question of whether it helps accessibility in practice is somehow illegitimate notwithstanding what I think of specific features, it is hard to make a good spec when there are sacred cows that may not be examined critically, so I don't know how much we can accomodate that point of view i'm not considering any cows sacred I would suggest that if headers got some kind of priority and a determination made, even if the determination was ""keep it"", there would just be a move to argue the next accessibilty issue in dispute immediately. I would not make it a special priority just to give those evangelizing for it a more immediate answer. i'm not really concerned about appeasing people, i want to make the spec the best html spec possible, including addressing the goal of making documents that use the language universally accessible. I know you don't - I'm just saying it's hard to collaborate with someone who does have sacred cows, even if you happen to agree with them on one point But it makes everyone's life miserable when some people consider cows to be sacred and they are taken to slaughter (so to speak) 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: yeah 1e4ee64444841994c72c2d5293d9734b: yeah. so that argues for just treating it like any other issue, and going with the FIFO principle, right? That would be my take on it, yes. i think that's probably the best course of action And for parsing logs later to write emails, I say that as a person with a general accessibility interest/focus/etc. i expect Dan to start telling me to prioritise public-html wg feedback over existing whatwg feedback though. he seems to have interpreted my ""a few months"" as ""3 or so months"" not ""20 or so months"" which is probably closer to realistic. I do think Chaals made a good point that accessibility features might deserve special status even if only a subset of especially accessible sites use them (properly), since those might be the only sites that someone with a given disability can use at all not sure what to do about that if he does ask me to do so but I don't know if the evidence bears that out as a justification for headers="""" or the like 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: Two stacks, one issue from the top of each in turn? it would require examples of actual particularly accessible sites that consistently use it in a way that is beneficial not just a theory that there might be some 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: well, there are two things, right, there's the features that are rarely used but when used make the page better, and there are the features that are very widely misused to the point where they actively hurt the user's experience on most sites longdesc clearly falls into the latter category according to all the studies i've done or seen as in, exposing longdesc will mostly expose the user to spam or useless content, even on supposedly accessibility-aware pages would think that the way tabindex is implemented, it actively hurts the user experience too. treating all positive numbers as 0 for tabindex would, i think, have better user experience that's possible too, i haven't even looked at tabindex yet other than adding the negative thing yep. :) i just suddenly came to think of tabindex when reading the above one thing i really don't know how to fix is accesskey="""" dunno either That isn't going to be fun. although opera's implementation is somewhat useful, or at least not harming the user experience opera's implementation is unintuitive From what I remember Mike Smith saying it sounds like different solutions are appropriate on different devices and doesn't actually solve the problem of how to make it device independent yeah maybe it really is a stylistic thing we do have key-equivalent in CSS iirc 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I would assume users wouldn't see the spam or useless content since they wouldn't be explicitly asking their tool to give them the longdesc, except in the cases where they have a good expectation that it's going to be useful, so misuse wouldn't hurt the user much ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: really? how would they know to ask? for longdesc it really seems to me that the only cases i've seen where the longdesc was actually useful and wasn't something you could have just stuffed into alt="""", it was actually useful to sighted users too and could have just been included on the page or in a link from the page I'd assume the tool would indicate in some quick way that there is a longdesc attached to the image, similarly to how it must quickly indicate wherever there is a link but I have precisely no experience of how relevant tools work in practice jaws says ""press enter for long description"" after reading the image alt, and if you press enter it will open the url in a new window iirc right but how do you know it's appropriate? (At least from what I've heard about table headers, they're not read out by default - you press some key when you've got the right cell selected, and if you see one cell has rubbish headers then you won't bother checking every single other cell - so the harm caused by misuse is similarly minimised) 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: By considering the context, like whether other images on the page have useful longdescs - e.g. you'd know it's worthwhile reading all the longdescs in the CSS spec after you've seen the first few (and on sites which misuse it, you'd quickly realise you should just ignore all the rest) that doesn't seem like the optimal user experience it's like reminding the user continually that the page wasn't designed for them but there's this secondary set of content they can access seems like it would make one bitter tries to build up a list of requirements for offline web apps It seems a less significant negative point than with e.g. <input usemap> (where if your browser supports it, there are features of some sites that just don't work at all) - it might waste a bit of time to read out useless longdescs, but it's not preventing the user from using the site A closer-to-optimal user experience would be good, though I don't have any ideas for that :-) yeah the main argument for me against longdesc is that it's not useful at all, except in rare cases where frankly sighted users would benefit too, and therefore you're better off putting the content on the page itself 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: one thing that might work is to limit the number of access keys and make it a set that UAs can map in a natural way on each platform to something w/ no conflicts it's hard to say since i've seen so few useful uses of it 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: yeah that's been suggested 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: but then the UI becomes unclear 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: i.e. discoverability drops through the floor 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: having CSS-useable hooks could help with styleability yeah s/styleability/discoverability/ like ...:after { content: ' (' copy-key ')'; } ... { key-equivalent: copy-key; } yeah or ... { key-equivalent: copy-key; } ...::after { content: ' (' key-equivalent ')'; } ...to have resilience against the cascade ....:access-key('n'):after { content: 'meta-key N'} yeah i was thinking of also having 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c's idea since that solves the device problem too Subtitles on TV shows would benefit sighted users too (e.g. when they get distracted and miss a couple of words, or can't understand someone's accent), but usually they aren't displayed along with the content since they're ugly and distracting and not sufficiently useful to be shown to all users; people may have similar reasons for not wanting to put image descriptions in the normal page content, and hiding it being [D] links or londesc 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: is om's idea of having a limited set? s/being/behind/ yeah but subtitles aren't only accessible to blind users or hidden behind long properties pages, they're one-button accessible like an <a> link would be 6905646aa63b96d6bdfbd256603fa58e: yeah see above That just seems like a browser UI issue yeah, me wishes browsers couldn't remap stuff that the browser already handles or allow me to re-remap it ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: i don't think we should hide longdesc behind a context menu or something. i'm saying the link should be right there in the content just like for everything else. That sounds like D-links - I think the only argument I've heard against them is they don't look very nice (but there are quite possibly other arguments I haven't heard) 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: if the set was 0-9 for instance, it could be unmodified 0-9 on phones with a keypad, Cmd-0 - Cmd-9 on Macs, Ctrl-0 - Ctrl-9 on windows, etc (assuming those are actually free) ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: yeah, though i wouldn't use [D]. but I'm not sure how you address discoverability (http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#long-descriptions says ""Invisible d-links thus provide a (temporary) solution for designers who wish to avoid visible d-links for stylistic reasons."") I think the page has to provide info about shortcuts 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: i think 6905646aa63b96d6bdfbd256603fa58e's idea helps with that I think there's some kind of study that says numeric shortcuts aren't really free, though. that's how keyboard shortcuts work in native apps they are listed in the menu bar having a shortcut list with labels somewhere in the page or accessible from the chrome would be the natural analogy I'm not sure if styling them to mention they key helps yeah, having it in the chrome seems reasonable thee UA could do a better job if it is the only thing that knows the concrete key mapping, but you need a label to go next to the shortcut *the UA it could even be a menu or submenu in the menu bar hm yeah, for <command>s and other Command elements you could just have the UA create a menu somewhere with the key equivs ""Page Shorcuts"" it'd be nice in interactive browsers if you could could style the access-key elements with the modifier key is pressed they could do that now with :active 6905646aa63b96d6bdfbd256603fa58e: if the modifier is a commonly used one on the OS, that could be distracting 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: indeed it could something based on <command> seems like a good basic approach oh i misread what 6905646aa63b96d6bdfbd256603fa58e said the idea is that a shorcut key actually activates a command, for which there might also be one or more UI elements there are some places, like dialogue windows in os x, where this is done already it makes more sense to associate it with a command, which can then have an appropriate label 6905646aa63b96d6bdfbd256603fa58e: example? (I don't know of dialog windows that have keyboard shortcuts beyond the standard tab/enter/esc and such) I remember something adding ""cmd-foo"" in a button when cmd is pressed down I'm not sure where that is I don't think that is standard it's not I'm just seeing that I've seen it done before and I helped with discoverability usually in OS X all the keyboard shorcuts also have a menu item, so you can look in the menu system to see the shortcuts 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: true Windows is different since it uses the underline system sometimes, and that may apply both to menus and items in a dialog"

I wouldn't expect it it's from last year, maybe year before I believe WebKit used in 3DS browser is kinda dated. http://www.nintendo.com/3ds/internetbrowser/sourcecode/ it's NetFront WebKit so yes, probably they package it up and make it easier to port ""Canvas element (einige)"" ""CSS3 (einge)"" interesting. let me check my phone NetFront Browser v3.5 ooh. the Changelog shows the last commit is dated as of 2009-12-21 interesting! So it has the capabilities of... 2 year old webkit Notably, the browser engine of the 3DS is listed as ""NetFront(R) Browser NX 1.0"", so presumably there is or will be a newer version at some point in the future Version.xcconfig says that webkit version is 532.8 that's Google Chrome 4 can't remember what kinda features that Cr4 offered... me neither let me google it HTML5 video and audio was added before version 4 Version 4 has ACID3 fully passing hmm 99d799105c5630cb16b3a7b54e6ae26e: thanks for the open source link btw Ha! at that time there weren't stable builds for Mac and Linux np! ooh websockets they're probably disabled, but there is a folder for them it might just be stubs, though let's see if websockets work :D oh, says they don't when I go to a test shame they were either incomplete or disabled at build-time 99d799105c5630cb16b3a7b54e6ae26e: although it's practically guaranteed to be disabled I'm looking for audio stuff Thing is, unfortunately, it uses WebKit cuz everyone loves WebKit ;) ;( yeah except people looking for old deprecated elements Bah, webkit which it doesn't support 99d799105c5630cb16b3a7b54e6ae26e: woo, 3DS canvas seems to be properly done unlike on my phone where it ignored one of my transforms and hence everything was double the correct height 2f9d518848f2539fc7f17c1e518648ad: woops. mislooked '3DS canavas' as 3D canvas. bah. yeah :/ you know what really excites me? CSS 3d transforms you know what I hate about them? they aren't hardware accelerated seriously, they would otherwise be a really nice way to do 3D in the browser far easier than WebGL paul_irish my issue was closed? http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=104075 99d799105c5630cb16b3a7b54e6ae26e: I just realised if I can render JPGs in the browser I can display 3D images using data URLs ! because the 3DS supports displaying 3D images in the browser and MPO is just two JPEGs concatenated YES! The 3DS supports Data URIs now to somehow make a JPEG with JS"

Definitely not for page ranking, anyway. Less-so for page content so whats the point? It's extremely useful for in-house searching You know you can trust them, so they're meaningful to you kk the term UA could definitely include search engines is there a way, using a text input, that when the users hits enter (to say, ie, submit) it performs a javascript function onkeypress so every time a key is pressed, i have to send that to a javascript function to check if its ENTER, and if so, then perform the function yep I don't remember how to check for which key google should help you there's no way to ""submit"" to a function() rather than a .PHP or .CGI etc using only html? mmm it would seem to me that there should be you might be able to override form.submit same =/ I haven't tried it k i'll look into that idea document.getElementById('formname').submit = function() {blah} something like that but I don't know if the browser uses the submit javascript function the browser is probably working at a level outside of javascripts scope oh wait silly me lol <form onsubmit()> if you return false it doesn't submit I think exactly erm, /s/()/=""function()"" if you want it to be for a specific text field then it's trickier ie, form with multiple text fields, only capture enter on a specific field there's also one for the lost focus event, but that one usually ends up annoying the crap out of users i found the best method, seems to be: <form onSubmit=""javascriptInstead(); return false""> yah =) i just read up a bit haha thanks Or just don't use a form and put script on the buttons what event? onclick (and possibly onkeypress to catch space/enter) i wouldnt say keypress is a more simple or better solution onclick is But if the idea is to know which button was used, then the form doesn't help any. Construct one set of event sfor the button, stick them on each one, scrap the form, and sit back and watch lights blink or use onsubmit, create function to analyze the textinputs if that's what you're trying to accomplish (i wasnt), and be able to submit a JS function with the enter key instead of clicking anything at all"

Fortunately, the whole thing flopped. yeah, I wonder how the current trend will play out in the long run also, I don't really want any special interest to replay the digital tv coup, where they made a lot of people replace hardware just because yeah, that would be bad but in this case, people seem to like the convenience hahahahah this smart card stuff has nothing to do with user convenience oh it's all about vendors convincing governments that there's a problem that needs solving ah when that same problem has never been equally solved pre-Internet and the sky hasn't fallen a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: sorry if ""hahahahah"" was rude. but this is so far removed from the needs of the *users* I guess I don't really know what the difference is between smart cards and the contactless cards and e-wallet features on mobile phones we have in Japan no problem man :) you should laugh more often! I'm glad to provide some mirth anyway, the use case I had in mind is just the use case of being able to pay for stuff easily without needing to carry cash I take it that in Europe, the use case that the vendors are trying to sell governments on is just electronic identification what goverments in Europe try to do is to make login to government Web sites more ""secure"" than login to Google or Paypal and more secure than login to banks aha Hmm, the situation we have is that login to government websites is pretty much equivalent to login to banks because, you know, no one has never just phoned a government office and stated their name and id number b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: in Finland, login to goverment sites is now outsourced to banks, because the smart card thing sucked so badly Right, taht is mostly the case here There are various identity providers and banks are one of them Banks in turn are typically protected by some kind of hardware challenge/response system this situation is *much* better than smart cards, because because typing some numbers from a laminated piece of paper is browser, OS and device-neutral (not sure if I am using the right technical terms here) b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: over here, the ""hardware"" that the user possesses is a piece of paper with some plastic coating b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: works great except with gullible people and phishing (but the system is device neutral to the extent that the bank website works on different devices/browsers) (and one option for government login requires java. There is also a mobile phone based alternative) but then, smart cards are also vulnerable to gullible users in fact, using smart cards requires more leaps of faith from the user b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: Here you get some hardware for which you have a PIN. The bank site presents a number, you enter that number into the device and then enter the corresponding number into the bank website. b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: I guess that protects gullible people from blatant phishing better than what we have b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: but probably doesn't help people who are excessively gullible compared to the piece of paper that is with the piece of paper, the bank is supposed to ask for one printed number at a time but since the user has all the numbers available, a particularly audacious phisher can ask the user to type *all* of them at once of course, the user has to be super-gullible to fall for that one I don't know if people who fall for that one can be helped in terms of computer security b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: I'm wondering how the validator deals with ""xmlns:"" in text/html I see the parser does not expose ""xmlns:*"" as attributes to the rest of the SAX pipeline as far as I can see and doesn't support the sax namespace-prefixes feature so I'm wondering how the validator service is able to see report xmlnis:* attributes a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: IIRC, the parser reports them, then doesn't show them to the pipeline ah, OK hmm, but jing sees them oh. then I misremember well, I mean I can see that the error message seems to be a kind that jing emits ""Attribute xmlns:foo not allowed here"" oh no that is emitted by the parser my bad that's in the treebuilder code a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: yes. private void checkAttributes(HtmlAttributes attributes, @NsUri String ns) yep yep OK, that is good news or good for me to get confirmation of that a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: fun with RDFa, eh? you guessed it man xmlns is deprecated in RDFa 1.1 a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: I suggest not supporting deprecated parts however, the spec currently says, ""Conformance checkers must accept attribute names that have a case insensitive prefix matching ""xmlns:"" as conforming. Conformance checkers should generate warnings noting that the use of xmlns: is deprecated."" yeah agreed if anything that part of the spec should be changed to say, ""Conformance checkers may report xmlns attributes as errors"" anyway, it's also not clear whether xmlns is an error in RDFa Lite or not not clear to me anyway oh, looks like gecko implementation of Network Status API just landed https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=677166 And some SMS stuff too navigator.mozConnection.bandwidth SMS stuff? https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=674725 wishes this stuff wasn't moz-prefixed that SMS landing sure had lots of changesets wishes this stuff was being specced b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9, even better, it didn't build 8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81: IIRC, there's a draft for the network status API 8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81: is there not a spec for SMS? On wikimo the implementation is different from network status API draft for good reasons hopefully the spec will get revised AIUI, the plan is to try to establish a significant legacy through b2g, and then spec our implementation 8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81: is wikimo not a spec but draft in some random website which has html or html5 in the domain name is a draft? though, perhaps you did mean that wikimo draft is a draft spec No, what I meant is that wikimo is owned by one vendor, while html5.org or whatwg.org isn't html5.org and whatwg.org are both owned by employees of vendors Sure But wikimo is a Mozilla asset, and whatwg.org isn't a Google asset ok b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: sent you some patch review requests a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: I'll take a look thanks sorry it's all pretty boring stuff"

I'd rather have prose than complex regex oh well. you're doing the work, not me. 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46, hosting at code.google.com might work, as long as we can keep a copy in w3.org somewhere too. does code.google.com offer an rsync interface? I'd rather use a decentralized version control system like hg or bzr or git 587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef: and anne said that I was the person to ask if he ever needed an overly complex regex :P 587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef: ^[^.0123456789]*([0123456789]+\.[0123456789]*|[0123456789]*\.[0123456789]+|[0123456789])(<unicode character class Zs>)*((%|Ÿ™|Ô?™|ÔºÖ|‚Ä?|‚Ä±)[^0123456789]*|[^.0123456789]*([0123456789]+\.[0123456789]*|[0123456789]*\.[0123456789]+|[0123456789])[^0123456789%Ÿ™Ô?™ÔºÖ‚Ä?‚Ä±]*)$ 587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef: I think that expresses the algorithm‚Ä¶ written out as BNF, it's probably quite straightforward since, for example, [0123456789] gets factored out as <digit> *DIGIT ""."" +DIGIT / +DIGIT ""."" *DIGIT / DIGIT covers a floating point number in ABNF, I think It'll be simpler than URI's ABNF for certain though when you said ""a lot of the requirements would end up being English prose anyway"" I thought you were saying that there are constraints that can't be expressed in BNF. I don't see any so far. ratios probably isn't the best of examples I think it's worth publishing BNF for these things, even if it has to be a separate document. I've got a handful of volunteers for the formalization task. dates would end up being verbose if you wanted to be exact (RFC3339's ABNF allows hours > 24, minutes > 59, seconds > 60) I've got nothing against publishing some sort of BNF, but I'd rather the prose were the only normative part of the standard true, capturing leap year rules in regex's isn't worthwhile. \d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\d plus some prose constraints is a happy medium. I liked BNF more before I started dealing with URIs and IRIs. 3.2.3.4. Ratios doesn't motivate any of the complexity. the regex at the end of the URI spec works much better than the BNF. URIs aren't parsed top-down like programming languages; they're chopped up piece by piece they aren't that nice when you do try and parse them without using regex </complete:understatement> URI syntax is particularly horrible, and it took a long time to figure out the bounds of the standard. (it's still ongoing). 587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef: don't know I wonder where this %|Ÿ™|Ô?™|ÔºÖ|‚Ä?|‚Ä± stuff came from. Surely no cows blazed any path like that. 587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef: it's allowed as content of elements yes, but why bother with ‚Ä± ? is that really worthwhile? why go beyond one % character? hmm‚Ä¶ URIs predate me :\ (though I think any standards regarding URL/URIs are younger) 587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef: the arabic one is really used by arabic people. wild. I think it's best to return to my ""I don't care what design you come up with, as long as there are plenty of tests and the implementors are willing to pass them"" mode. needs lunch is late for a telcon :-/"

How I can tell what set of codepoints the output string can contain? font subsetting is hard It'd be easier if OS X wasn't silly enough to convert strings to NFC before trying to render them I thought OSX converted to NFD Not when rendering text, as far as I'm aware If you write HTML with ""i{combining grave}"" then it'll try to find the glyph corresponding to ""{i grave}"" (I already have code that finds a superset of the necessary codepoints, but want something stricter) OS X uses NFD for HFS+, but otherwise uses NFC. a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: well, almost NFD for HFS+, IIRC, it's a special normalization that isn't quite exactly any real normalization form I think the differences are in the Korean block How can you find out if something is in an array? (in JS) Hangul isn't decomposed or something of that nature I forget Argh NFC(U+1e60 U+0323) = NFC(U+1e62 U+0307) = U+1e69 s/1e62/1e63/ s/1e60/1e61/ Uh, something like that What I currently do is convert everything to NFD, and then find all codepoints that decompose into a subset of those NFDs, but that is both inefficient and incorrect (Incorrect because UnicodeData.txt doesn't always give maximal decompositions, and inefficient because e.g. {i grave} will get decomposed into a combining grave even though there's no need to include that character)"

I must admit it's quite useful functionality but it prevents the canvas-is-a-bunch-of-vectors and canvas-is-a-bunch-of-pixels people from coexisting peacefully i hope canvas.width and height at least return the correct pixel amount or that there's some way of getting the dimensions for getting the whole canvas contents canvas.width/height are the size in canvas coordinate units, which are not necessarily related to the number of device pixels in the backing buffer that the implementation uses var fac = getImageData(0,0,1,1).width oh but maybe it's fractional, var fac = getImageData(0,0,canvas.width,1).width/canvas.width There's no requirement for it to even be linear, I think You could have a higher pixel density in the left of the image perhaps because you know the user is looking at their screen from the side, and you don't need so many pixels in the distance :--------| Oh, actually, that's not true Oh, actually, I think it might be It's required that context.createImageData(w, h).width == context.getImageData(0, 0, w, h).width but maybe it could differ if you change the getImageData x"

This is why people drink it. So why would you doubt it? WHAT are you doubting? jpa-, If the male brain is more dopaminergic than is the female brain, than coffee would accentuate this affect. jpa- Are you saying, scientifically, that dopamine is in equal proportions in the brains of both genders? jpa-, Now THAT would surprise me.

non-predator,94e49adf55eaf50ebce7c0efe6f04e67,"heycam, style.filter is the same as document.all due to the SVG WG not renaming it to avoid conflicts with IE well, WebKit does style.filter that way though it's even weirder, since the return is normally a string we have to make it a special string-like thing that masquerades as undefined dunno what other browsers do I think we do something else but it is causing issues is saved by semicolon insertion For some inexplicable reason I was accidentally printing a date in the middle of a <script> generated by some code, so there was a spurious line saying ""2009-05-31"" and it must have been interpreted as a statement computing 1973 with an implicit semicolon at the end, so it didn't cause a syntax error and it's been like that for about six months"

At least, that's my interpretation on what I am seeing from these dev folks. response: Pretty much, Opera support would be nice, but not a huge issue for me right now.

Time will tell how it will go.

It's a bit funny. When people were IE-only devs they got called names, but when you do chrome-only it should suddenly be alright? :-P chrome is new IE tons of features That statement in and of itself is scary :) activex! aka nacl OMG! By 2020 Chrome will have 200% market share! 99% :) and 1% - lynx b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: Anyway, did those responses help you a bit? :) Alternative theory: linear extrapolation without regrad for the actual dynamics is bad 2466054b396284f05e6f6e4e7d3c806d: Well sort of. I don't kow much about the audio work I just know that the chrome API looks really complicated b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: Ah ok I haven't played with it yet. It's a much more declarative approach But I know many gamedevs are looking at the webbrowser for implementing more involved games than the social ones available now and also to build their tools in Possibly all that complexity is needed, but my expectation is that it's not IIRC Insomniac Games already deployed some tools to browser-only. First steps are harder than usual, as you have to get used to the concept behind the nodes but after that it's really easy to work with I was just curious if and when FF will support Web Audio API as well :) An umbrella draft was published about a week ago The Audio Working Group is still in flux about which proposal they're going to pursue So is Chrome a bit too early with their implementation? no earlier than Mozilla is Which are prefixed? 770d372f0f632c0570c7dc952127b0dc: Sorry, not up to date on all implementation details, so bear with me please :) Mozilla/Gecko already has it in Nightly or so? 8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81, yes, both are. 2466054b396284f05e6f6e4e7d3c806d, Mozilla has the Audio Data API, which provides similar (though through a more imperative way) functionality https://wiki.mozilla.org/Audio_Data_API The umbrella document is here: http://www.w3.org/2011/audio/drafts/1WD/ 770d372f0f632c0570c7dc952127b0dc: thanks, forwarding and adding to my own reading list is there any abstraction for all that? i am thinking about porting libglitch"

PlasmaHH: that's not right... it should be ""/usr/share/vim"" PlasmaHH: did you perform the echo in Vim? excuse my paste, vim - status is manual. link currently points to /usr/bin/vim.basic Current `best' version is /usr/bin/vim.gtk. Hideo_Kuze: the first line was all I needed :) Hideo_Kuze: that should point to vim.gtk Hideo_Kuze: so, it looks like you adjusted the alternative before which is why it is in manual mode hm... I haven't touched it in ages wonder what caused the change but it works now, thanks a lot, jamessan :) so by default it should be auto right yup it changes to manual when the user makes a change or the maintainer handles things improperly thank you jamessan, it's way less irritating now :) jamessan: yes I did Hideo_Kuze: welcome :) PlasmaHH: well, that's not correct at all. do you happen to have $VIM set in the shell, too? jamessan: no, its not set there. and if $VIM should contain /usr/share/vim then /usr/share/vim/current is right here probably PlasmaHH: are you running Debian? nope the question for me is, why doesnt it contain /etc ? $VIM is usually the parent directory of $VIMRUNTIME so, it wouldn't normally be /etc hmk hm, on the other system with 6.4 its the same, but there the /etc/vimrc is read in, so I suspect some read in/set $VIM order has changed PlasmaHH: in some systems /usr/share/vim/vimrc is simply a symbolic link to /etc/.../vimrc, but vim doesn't read that file through the /etc almost never (the only one that I've seen doing it is gentoo). gentoo doesn't do that HELO BYE RST ciaranm: I have memories of that being the system vimrc in gentoo /etc/vim/* in gentoo no symlinks but of course, you know better than I :-) oh, that's what I was saying the exception to the symlink is gentoo my sentence was not clear Anyone know if there's some fundamental reason in vim why I can't have two :match patterns active at once? LeoNerd: you can always use | to merge more patterns... Yeah.. but then they'd all be the same colour... ah I would find it useful to have two... I have one for characters beyond the 80th column, and one for Template::Toolkit tags.. it'd be nice to have them apply independently, in different colours... no idea It was more of a question of internals, to developers...

73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46, well, i think the discussion should be had in a broader audience. But from a security point of view that is fine with me c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059: ok 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46, possibly we could allow crazier names for HTML nodes than for non-HTML nodes clearly some characters shouldn't be allowed in tag names e.g. ' ' or '>' so if we're going to have to do checks anyway it seems like we might as well do more IE allows ' ' and '>' as tag name is generally reluctant to change the spec given how much effort has gone into following the spec and testing it in the first place i wonder where dom core discussion should take place 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46: I have a system waiting without the tests, because I haven't yet seen 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e say that the spec is stable enough for a lot of test to be written 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46: I suppose i should start writing tests regardless b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: you could write tests as you fix bugs b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: how does the system work? if i want to contribute with tests The system requires each test to live on an HTTP server somewhere then the tester front end is asked to dump JSON for that URL this JSON can the be edited to make the permitted error locations more wide then the JSON reference dump is committed to a big JSON file using the front end tool the front end can then run all the tests in the big file or be asked to run individual tests also, there's a testing system for the tokenizer (html5lib) and thee builder (html5lib) but the bugs you found recently where ouside the tokenizer in the IO layer I'm not at my develoment machine ATM I can write docs for this tomorrow b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: so how would a test for the ascii bug look like? 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46: <!DOCTYPE html><title>?§</title> served without charset on the HTTP layer b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: doesn't it need to say somehow what is expeced? 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46: yeah, but I can't autogenerate the reference JSOn from this computer b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: ah ok but it's basically the out=json format I see JF still thinks that any decision made at any point equals attaching semantic meaning a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9, that line of reasoning is just stretching the truth in order to fit his preconceived notions How would he handle an image that was selected at random, like 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e's front page image? now he's going for the whole ""choice"" argument, saying we should include it simply because it provides another choice why do you people even listen to the guy c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059, pong he's obviously either a crackpot or a troll 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, we don't, he's just funny well, his arguments are starts his stopwatch to see how long it takes for someone to complain to public-html about his inappropriate behaviour 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I do it to atone for my otherwise merciless commentary I wonder if he has ever heard of the paradox of choice? Or used a Mac I bet he's a big fan of linux on the desktop ;) is a big fan of gnome-on-linux-on-the-desktop :) c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059, I guess you settled it with 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e wonders who those anonymous people are who are spamming Chrome accessibility links on his blog"

Surely SOMEBODY has kept the old GPL sources someplace. heh old.swshader.net.org.sex.com.scsi.ru it's broken in such a way that bootcd crashed vmware right after starting to boot Encoded, you really suck, you know that? :( I tried to install bootcd r23251 and that didn't work.

""also"" was referring to Fireball's problem fixing this line doesn't fix my problem btw ;( under vpc2004 during 2nd stage setup just after registering dlls, ntoskrnl throws a kmode exception not found seems to be a GDI thing...

You still haven't said what you are actually trying to do ... well seeing as i need a boot disc to install windows well lets see you can copy installation files to disk, and try to run it from there boot disc + install , boot disc + install , gee i dunno what im doing :) pihhan, nah ill just use the cd buddy :) i appreciate your assistance urban, I answered that a half hour ago. But you decided I was a moron, so, good luck :) just stating the obvious quux, pihhan will be able to teach you lots :) Actually, you are about to discover that the ME cd isn't bootable. Actually i knew that , thats why im asking for a boot disc lool :| nice comeback I give up. who can ever made install disk without booting manager? bootable cds ? that didnt start till 97' well and me is released when? dunno :| what about millenium? ;-) ;) touche` nice touch , but why its not bootable i have no idea bad os welcome to WinME lol enjoy your stay in hell never had windows ME CD in hand, sorry i did not know :) quux, so in managing your domains, do you use the GUI mostly or do you script most of your tasks? depends on the task :D i have my msdos discs as well :D Basically if it needs to be repeated often, I'll write a script. If it's a one off thing, I'll do whatver is easiest quux, domain users displayed in simplified users management from control panels are only because they are members of local groups? pihhan, correct if you take away the domain controller and look at the list again, often you will see only the SID well problem is i changed pdc software, and domain sid changed after that, there are problems everywhere Ah. No way to reclaim the old domain SID (unless Samba allows that somehow) samba allows it of course so basically all you can do is remove the old accounts from localgroups and add the new ones but only 3.0 and higher, which is there now :( allows you to manually determine the SID your domain will have? well that i did of course :) we are at linux, configuration options never ends :) sometimes :) i am missing verbose logs on windows workstations :D server logs are not enough :) never are :| and you dont get groovy log.rotate options as they are telling authentication sucessful, and windws does reject me .. :) heh I know samba has a getsid thing, but where do you *set* it? ever try ntp quux, yes and if you have ldap i heard it was nice , my syntax might be wrong , i have never used it personally you can change nearly whatever you want for example machine trust password :) lightweight directory access protocol but the question is specific. Where exactly do you set that? but you have to know what is windows using, and that is i am not so skilled net setlocalsid if i remember right urban, ldap, yeah, cool thing if it works and you have good tools urban, it dont work well to me though :( yeah , its touchy , doesnt like mysql mod_auth either :| should be domain sid same as domain master pdc, right? pihhan, yes. FOr an nt4 style domain, all DC's share the same domain SID urban, well, ldap is in apache2 common package present, played with some days ago if you change the dc SID, I imagine you might have to do some sort of 'change sids for all user accounts and groups' command as well pihhan, try making your ftp use hyperlinks with multiple users , with the mysql auth and not get a headache quux, well, dont you know how to make tool or script to add acls to users profile directory and to its registry? know how, yes. have done, no so, how to make it? subinacl would be the tool, since it can do registry permissions as well i were looking for windows api to make something in c++, but its soo strange and that :) really? yeah :D have to try it :) it has pretty involved syntax, but it can do the deed is it on winxp support tools? Not sure. either there or one of the resource kits. I have this one big directory I dump all my cli tools into; I forget where each of them originally came from :) started something like that already too well, to test windowz i have to reboot see ya :)"

Hi, I have to make an embedded captive portal access point for a public environment. I'm not interested about billing, but I' have to log everything... Anyone can tell me a solutions? I'm oriented about wrap pc engine... you could use a transparent web-proxy, but what to do with non http traffic? i also recommend to use ""host isolation"" option if ap has it What do you think about chillispot and embedded debian solution? Also with a radius server...? my hotspot experience is limited to mikrotik, which unfortunately is propietary I see... And with microtik, what about...? I'm studying about; I'm not locked on a particular platform... i have not tested public access hotspots either... i'm not sure how to do it you could have a simple welcome page, with a shared username/password for everyone, and you could log every new tcp/udp connection or something you can do that using software libre imho my target is to have more user, one account for one user. because the italian law about anti terrorism want this. And I also have to log when user log in and out. And also the ""transparent proxy"" log, for the visited domain... heh, but in a public access hotspot users can instant create their accounts for free, dont they? Sure, for free.... the thing is that you cannot use webproxy for non standard ports, including anonymous proxies, etc That's the idea: I have a friend with a snack bar. He wants to share the internet connection with the bar customer.... block all outgoign traffic and force the use of the proxy but that makes kind of a useless connection the problem is https may not work then you can proxy https you can block all traffic until you log in, then open it but somehow log every new tcp/udp connection Ok, that's right... But how can I do this...? There's a template or any howto over there...? i don't know sigh.. Thanks people... I will return to googling the internet searching about.... Thanks."

Quick question... can I do this in Chrome yet...? http://jsfiddle.net/pcUPa/ <- To create an unsigned 32-bit view of the 2D canvas image data Uint8ClampedArray data attribute? db2cc1c368ad9561e1bbcda07105e8fd: the handshake is a normal http request. the unmasked 'headers' in the protocol frames are a few bytes of binary flags (not http headers). the 'attack' is very ususual, and very unlikely to still be possible with masking db2cc1c368ad9561e1bbcda07105e8fd: i don't know if that made anything clearer. i can try to answer any questions you have, though Any takers for my 2D canvas question? :-s so a friend said that people are not using flash fallback for html5 videos anymore. what are people using instead ? 71bd9426656c7068876f52fb7934af7f: ah, I think that makes sense... (admittedly, I haven't had a chance to inspect the data with wireshark yet). and the handshake response is not seen by the client, so I guess that prevents any misuse of the handshake response (assuming the proxy were to misinterpret the handshake) seen by the attacker, rather db2cc1c368ad9561e1bbcda07105e8fd: right 71bd9426656c7068876f52fb7934af7f: thanks db2cc1c368ad9561e1bbcda07105e8fd: np 6d2cddd61c68e5e8d13a65f218e358f5: i see the Uint32Array in chrome dev. i don't think the putImageData call is working 71bd9426656c7068876f52fb7934af7f, hmm... maybe it's not creating an ArrayBuffer view that references the original data.

Does Moz render the page incorrectly? yes hm Try putting <!-- and --> on their own lines they are...it was just easier to enter it on one in ir c Weird... assuming that the comment text doesn't contain ""--"", then even a full SGML parser should count it as a comment humm... Maybe a *ml validator could catch an error, if there is one. Actually... check the page info dialog in Moz to see if it's in quirks mode. That might explain why it's parsing it weirdly. ermm.. push it below something else? like below the <title>? That might be the problem, yeah, but should it matter? most browsers, including firefox isn't that strict about the sgml implementation, iirc I'd hope tag soup parsers would be more liberal about that omg A*S*YS, Hellrasier, BeXta and other producers are using myspace this is not good wtf does page have to full of someones crap and add up to megabytes? what does the <p> tag do `html p html p: <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/text.html#edef-P"">http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/text.html#edef-P</a> paragraph huh hwo do i tab yes in html you mean an indent? is there a tag for it yes `css text-indent css text-indent: <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/text.html#propdef-text-indent"">http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/text.html#propdef-text-indent</a> <label for=""Message"">Why would you use labels</label>? um accessibility and that you can use the for attribute is it for blind people or something? can be click on the label and you'll get focused on the input control well wouldnt it do that anyway wouldn't do what? clicking on the label get focused on input arooni: the usage should be like <label for=""target"">a</label><input id=""target""> so then i can click on the text which describes the input, and it will take me to the input? yes depends on the UA `html label html label: <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#edef-LABEL"">http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#edef-LABEL</a> it's in the specs, so most UAs should support it, where it is relevant unless its a text browser it's not relevant in a text browser exactly i haven't used a text browser though. but i think it is possible to support it well the 'click' is not relevant i have used a command line interface that provides for the mouse same but there are text browsers that don't use mouse"

non-predator,5ea2d9dd4eb720019d24a3b29bc9f220,"anybody here know much about translators (ie: the tr() function)? do you have a specific question about it? blockd: well, I have been thinking about the past 4 hrs actually and my brain is starting to melt. My question is this: Object A instantiates Object B and at the same time, tells B what the text that B is to draw. But I do not want A to literally tell B at instantiation time what that text is. Instead, I want A to tell B what the context and sourceText are for its text, and for B to later on look those up when B needs to draw itself . How do I do this? I was thinking that calling say: B->setText(tr(""foo"", ""bar"")) will not work because that literally tells B what its text is. See, the translator could change long aftter B has been created so I need to differ translation to later and tell B to lookup its text as close to the time it draws that text, as possible. like, for example, everytime the translator gets changed... so it would be ideal if I could then just tell B to re-sync its text based on the parameters it was given for lookup by A when it was created. can you sum that up tersely? you just need to update the translation if the user changes the language? locale rather... (e.g., make it a menu option or something) yes... basically, I want to differ translation lookup. dunno if this makes much sense... kind of hard to explain it... but basically, I want an object to lookup a localized translation from the translator using a context and sourceText that are passed to it. file:///usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-embedded-free-3.3.4-static/doc/html/qapplication.html#translate you could look at page 239 of the blanchette Qt 3 book for a solution 329 rather that is a print publication? !blanchette blockd: [blanchette] Co-author of the book C++ GUI Programming with Qt 3. You can download the book in PDF form from <a href=""http://www.phptr.com/content/images/0131240722/downloads/blanchette_book.pdf."">http://www.phptr.com/content/images/0131240722/downloads/blanchette_book.pdf.</a> not warez oh ok i figured blockd: here is what I thought is a solution. just gonna run it by you. it seems simple once I (think) got my head around it.... B->set_translator_context_data("""", QT_TR_NOOP(""Something""); and then, B would at some point, like when it is drawing its text, call something like: QString mytext = tr("""", context_str); oops... sorry... that first line should ahve beeen B->set_translator_context_data(QT_TR_NOOP(""something"")); that set_translator_context_data function would store the char * value of QT_TR_NOOP into some member variable and later ""dereference"" that value using the tr function.... sound ludicrous? maybe I am getting this all wrong blockd: btw... freaking awesome book :) thanks for the reference you're glossing over the part about ""drawing its text"" like you're going to override the paintEvent for each and every widget the solution in the book seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if you *have* to clear menu entries/columns and then readd them with the translation like it says... bit tired, but I'm not sure why he couldn't just setText with the new translation probably just a Qt 3 API issue of having to do it in the ctor and not having a setText... loquitus_of_borg: here's the idea in a nutshell loquitus_of_borg: <a href=""http://doc.trolltech.com/qq/qq08-swedish-chef-sequel.html#dynamic"">http://doc.trolltech.com/qq/qq08-swedish-chef-sequel.html#dynamic</a> blockd: yes...

Hooray for the common language. ahigerd do you know Qhttp? I've worked with it <a href=""http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/ubJL5K93.html"">http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/ubJL5K93.html</a> hmm..QObject::connect: Cannot queue arguments of type 'qint64' hmmmmmmmmmm Register it with QMetaObject? ? That's how you make connect able to queue new data types. Something like qRegisterMetaType There's info on the wiki i dont use queue hm Are you emitting signals across threads? yes Then they're queued. I still don't get it, ahigerd. Zola: ? <ahigerd> Zola: The debug{ and release{ blocks in qmake are for, for example, changing which libraries you want to include for each build. like I said earlier, everything I put in debug{ is being used when I build release Oh. I missed that. Strange. Don't know, then. I haven't had need for it. it was like that the last time I used Qt too <a href=""http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/JanF5B47.html"">http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/JanF5B47.html</a> ahigerd: so you can't just put separate options into debug{ and release{ ? I don't understand the purpose of them blockd: could you possibly mind RAFB'ing a minimal example of what you said? Zola: I'm sure there's some logical use for them. I just haven't had need for them, so I don't know how. ahigerd...hm dont know whats wrong;/ cplusplus: This 4.x? 4.1.3 k cplusplus: I don't think I understand what you're trying to accomplish. just sending get and post request from a thread Two questions... yeah? Actually, one question. Why? QHttp is asynchronous. You don't need threads. And in fact it works better if you DON'T use a thread. some more code: <a href=""http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/ODgL3c38.html"">http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/ODgL3c38.html</a> Sure, so why are you using a thread? QHttp doesn't block on requests. i cant give all the code into the on_Start_pressed function? Not very easily. that was the reason You should have it start the request and use the finished signal to trigger the next step. thats what i did;) You can SIMULATE blocking behavior by using my QSignalWaiter class but it's far cleaner to use the signals and slots the way they're intended. what should i try to do now?hm 'blockd' pasted ""Zola: an example"": <a href=""http://qtnode.net/pastebin/957"">http://qtnode.net/pastebin/957</a> cplusplus: Use a QBuffer as the QIODevice for the response data, then when the finished signal is emitted, handle it and start your next request. QBuffer..hm It's a QIODevice for a QByteArray little sample? Well, you see QHttp::request() has a QIODevice*to parameter? yeah Use a QBuffer in it and the response from the request will be stored in it. And that makes the requestFinished() signal work post() works for that too, I think QString str(""qID=14&answer=2""); QByteArray postdata_answere(str.utf8()); httpGetId = http_answere.request(header_answere, postdata_answere); ? Looks good to me, add the QBuffer If you need the return value Er, that is, the data from the server QBuffer for what? cplusplus: It'll contain the web page you requested hm You can use a QFile to store it directly to disk no Or for what it's worth you could relay it with QTcpSocket. Just listing possibilities. could i store it in QBuffer? The web page? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. following line fails: QByteArray postdata_answere(str1.utf16()); utf16 return ushort Um... Is that a Boost string class or something? sry: toUtf8 is right no i just use boost::thread Okay. So why DOESN'T it work...? no i just get the first response of the server Okay, so what's wrong? hm How does a QWidget's geometry() get determined if it has no layout within it and no sizeHint? like say I add a bunch of children to it... how does its geometry get determined? Um... I think it just sits there at whatever size it was when it was created. Some small rectangular size. I wouldn't assume anything. ahigerd: arbitrary or is the size driven by perhaps the smallest rectangle that bounds its children? Arbitrary, I think. But you may be right about the rectangle. Worth testing. yeah... I might do that. ahigerd i doesnt work without any threads...hm crazy How do you mean? What doesn't work? fuck;////////// <a href=""http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/vxE9HI40.html"">http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/vxE9HI40.html</a> hrm. I want something like QTextEdit.insertAt(), but without modifying the selection :\ Can you just store the selection and restore it after the insert? does Qt have unbuffered key input? Zola: keyPressEvent? isn't that one buffered? Zola: Oh, right. keyDown and keyUp, then. ahigerd: that is what i was thinking, except i am using these bindings and the getSelection method doesn't seem to be working as documented chip42: Which bindings? is keyDown and keyUp lossy? cplusplus: What's wrong? Zola: I don't think so like, it polls at a certain rate ahigerd: koala. they are packaged with kdebindings well then it's not unbuffered ahigerd all maybe;) ahigerd: java bindings *grin* chip42: Ah. you need unbuffered for game style input otherwise you get a much higher latency on the key input Zola: I think you'll have to use platform-dependent code for that, since event-driven keyboard handlers are almost guaranteed to be buffered. i'm actually using inserAt to put the text at the end. i would use append, but it is tacking on a new line which screws up the formatting Dunno. If it's a bug in the Java bindings there may be no way around it. But what's the point of using Qt with Java? are you kidding? qt is awesome. the question is what am i doing using java with qt. That's what I MEANT to say. :P its a completely arbitrary choice. i am forced to write a lot in java. i thought i'd do it for the hell of it gcj treats java like any other language. i'm able to compile and link my project like any other c++ app. i think it is cool, to say the least :) anyways, i read the newline with append() is qt3 related. insertAt was the recommended solution.. works well except it selects the text it is appending, producing a few sideffects when qt jambi released, i'll have qt as a real choice to do crossplatform java stuff. for now i am satisfied playing around with code confined to KDE hmmm Hmm? n8"

(or is that in standards mode only?) probably both as in, ""yes"" to both questions, probably right. and we want to deal with quirks :) (at least if the web relies on them) i wonder if i have some data on <base> elements it amused me when ms decided to ignore stray <base>s... obviously they based their implementation on document conformance requirements in html4 about 5% of sites have 1 <base> tag, apparently 0.03% have 2 uses base 0.0017% have 3 but does defining it with xml:base work? i mean if there are multiple <base>s in the same parent and a few thousand have more than 3 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46: i would make the xml:base be set on every element until the next <base>, i guess ah. right so we're talking about a few million pages here with 2 or more <base> elements i wonder how many have the same URI in both <base> elements there might be pages that use only one but have it in the middle <link href><base href><link href> oh actually this was only counting _different_ values for <base> so a few million pages use two different values for <base> so if you serialize to xml, do you drop the <base>s? afaict browsers don't ignore <base> in xhtml for some reason i think magical base resolution mechanism would work better i'm not an implementor though but i'm just observing what browsers are doing today :) yeah, dunno needs to study this more my main concern with supporting <base> in XHTML is that it means URI resolution will be different in XHTML UAs than pure XML UAs but i guess i can point the topic at myself ah. so you'd like to drop support for <base> in xhtml5 completely? that's what the spec says today iirc but people have argued against that I like base it makes it easy to develop entire websites and then move the whole thing only thing you need to change is a variable somewhere you like <base>, or you like the concept of having a base URI? base URI it says authors must not use it in xml. afaict it doesn't say uas must ignore it in xml ok well that's fine, nobody's talking about removing that feature :-) ah we're just talking about the syltax pipes down 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46: ah hehe today, browsers don't ignore <base> in xml, but since 0.00% of the web use xml it might not be much of an issue to change that :) :-) yeah, especially since 95% of pages don't use base stuff at all so that'd make it 5% of 0.00% :-) indeed :) I guess a physicist would call that 0.000% but <base href> changes the #document base uri. xml:base at best changes the root element's base uri (which makes a difference with xhr iirc) yeah talking about t-shirts here's one it just says ""XForms is the automobile."" on it lol I thought xforms was the lightbulb and HTML forms is LOAD AX, 1000 but we really need more declarative syntax for that op=""load"" ra=""ax"" rb=""1000"" ? we need spreadsheets to make our t-shirts it really should be <instruction><opcode>LOAD</opcode><operand type=""register"">AX</operand><operand type=""integer-constant"">1000</operand></instruction> then you can abstract opcode to be a processor-independent operation, and use psuedo-registers for your registers, and allow the author to add a declarative model of their instruction set and pipeline model don't forget version=""1.0"" on the <instruction> element and optimal code can be generated automatically You could do all your register allocation using XSLT most importantly, it can be produced by authoring tools for people who don't know about markup They don't even need to know assembly if we abstract away the commands well enough yes, we should have declaritive expressions for spreadsheets for people who can't author them, but we should also be sure to leave <font> out of it 'cause <font> is what those browser-makers want bc75c2548b71aed454f81ac6897bd078: to be fair, that's two separate groups of crazy people yeah but it's all crazy if you ask me I'm just waiting for the ""remove all vestiges of presentational markup"" people to get in a fight with the ""we need more presentational markup"" people someone should Cc Tina on the <indent> thread That would probably make the server kneel under the load"

I just needed to name my campaign :p Well I agree doing anything inconsistent is insane More insane than just copying whatever HTML already does However weird For someone who thinks that it is a wate of time to discuss rsayre is really fast to reply b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: you around? a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: yes a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: I saw the scrollback.

It's dual-licensed. which means what? (i know 2 licences, but thats about it) Which means if you pay Trolltech you can use it under a non-GPL license. so, i can use this eval as long as i want under gpl? probably not.. if I catch the drift of your question No, the eval is a demo of the commercial versions. i just got the vc2005 unsupported eval Yeah, that one isn't GPL. that and the supported eval are the only 2 on the site Nope, there's the open-source one too, under a different link. Bizzeh: what is it you want to do? Make an open source or proprietary application? its not anywhere under ""downloads"" so, its not where it should be really blockd: open <a href=""http://qtnode.net/wiki/Download_Qt"">http://qtnode.net/wiki/Download_Qt</a> so you have to mess around on google, or know where to look to find the free version, which has vc projects removed seems qt are more interested in pushing for peoples money than for free software the free version is easy to find.. but Trolltech's website *could* get to the direct download faster. You go to the Downloads section, then Qt, then the Open-Source link. but then again, I think they're just trying to make sure people use the right licence where the right licence is the one you have to pay for hardly If you're a closed-source developer, yes. If you're an open-source developer, no, but they don't want commercial developers getting the GPL one. so, trolltech are automaticaly assuming everyone is a closed source developer by hiding their opensource link away, and restricting the open sourced one's use I sensed sarcasm dripping from Bizzeh's last response there... next to last now... =p It's not hidden. Like I said: Downloads -> Qt -> Open Source are we being trolled <a href=""http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/downloads"">http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/downloads</a> no open source link on there <a href=""http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt"">http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt</a> Proceed to Supported Evaluation Registration Form Proceed to Unsupported Evaluation Registration Form You did Qt -> Download, not Downloads -> Qt ""Qt Open Source Downloads"" it's right on that page.. Bizzeh: yeah, that link doesn't have ""Qt Open Source Downloads"" on it at all. the link i posted doesnt have it there is no ""downloads"" link on the main page now *I'm* bei9ng sarcastic... wtf are you talking about, Bizzeh did you read the page you linked to? <a href=""http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/downloads"">http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/downloads</a> -> Qt Open Source Downloads there's something to be said for literacy. so, cut down, hidden version of the foss version, no vc integration with foss version, no vc support at all with foss version yep, thats usefull to me great, then you're all set.

Has that ever stopped you before? just explain that xhtml modularisation is a completely different concept from splitting up the HTML5 spec i'll let y'all handle that one :-) It seems to me that MoinMoin can't generate <th> in tables How's that for accessibility... <td colspan=""3"" style=""text-align: center""><p class=""line891""><strong>Heading</strong></td> (via http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/HelpOnTables ) Ayup The wiki-code for tables looks fairly ugly - does anybody have a nice way of marking up tables? kind of likes the LaTeX syntax, since you normally only need a single line of setup code and then every row is like ""cell1 & cell2 & cell3 \\"" which is about as minimal as possible Mediawiki's way is bad because it clashes with template syntax, but just markup-wise it covers most of it (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Tables etc) (You can't do the fancy stuff like col/colgroup/thead etc, but they allow plain html for the complex stuff) (Does that mean you can write a simple table with the wiki syntax, then add a few more complex features, but once you get to a certain point and want another feature you have to rewrite the entire thing into HTML?) No, you can just copypaste the output of the old code :) 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, you might be able to answer this more better than I can. http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/04/23/what-happened-to-operation-aborted.aspx#8422881 a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9: What if you want to remove that final feature and convert it back to the wiki syntax? :-) Run a regexp on it :) s/more better/better/ You could even write a wikicode serializer and link it to html5lib! f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: commented wonders if it's possible/sensible for a script to override document.write and intercept all the written strings (I'd like to let pages get proper HTML5 parsing by adding a line <!doctype html><script src=html5parser.js></script> to the top, but that seems like it'd be a bit messier if the page tries doing fancy scripting stuff itself) 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, there's a few more exceptions you forgot to mention, like always appending link and meta elements to the head, even if it's not open. though, I suppose that doesn't insepct the DOM to do that, it just maintains a separate head pointer hello 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c, I'm curious what your proposal is for an http based protocol for TCPConnection? 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c, 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e mentioned that the protocol was your main objection c4c52ee28b65ac033f57ce478087cfd1: I don't have a full proposal for how to satisfy the TCPConnection use cases 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c, Ok, I'm at least interested in the reasons for it my two problems with it are: (1) it uses port/host addressing instead of URI addressing, which is a poor fit for the Web model 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c, I'm putting together a document about the pros and cons of http for TCPConnection (2) it's bad to send non-http over the assigned ports for http and https (3) I am worried that connection to arbitrary ports could lead to security issues, although 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e tried hard to avoid them (basically the only security mechanism though is assuming that no other protocol will happen to emulate the TCPConnection handshake, which seems pretty weak) (given that other protocols have been found to have multiple interpretation vulnerabilities) I guess that is three problems ok i had a couple of other concerns With SSL there is no way to do virtual hosting -- you have to route on ip address... HTTP/1.1 upgrade with TLS solves this problem c4c52ee28b65ac033f57ce478087cfd1: I think a custom http method that begins a two-way session might be a promising solution, but I think that would require a proof of concept that it is viable on client and server side Http provides the Host header to avoid dns rebinding attacks 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c, it seems to me the way to do it is send an OPTIONS with an Upgrade: tcp/1.0 header as the client->server tcp handshake c4c52ee28b65ac033f57ce478087cfd1: those are also good points also, HTTP based connections include query parameters and cookies, allowing for normal auth mechanisms 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c, i'll add your three points to my document the big hurdle is keeping it simple enough for 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e's requirements, particularly that it be possible to implement in just a few lines of perl use Net::HTML5::Connection; run_server(); Should it be a few lines of Perl that a normal Perl programmer would write, or a few lines that a Perl golfer could write? ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c, he wants it to be 3 lines with no support libraries i dunno about 3 i think i said a few dozen but the point is it has to be a fully compliant implementation Is there any problem that can't be solved in a few dozen lines of Perl? the travelling salesman problem? b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f: That's a trivial problem to solve - just enumerate all possibilities and pick the best quickly, then. :) It's trivial to do it quickly, at least for certain input sizes :-) OK, I'll stop defending my quick and ill-thought-out reponse now anyone else want a go? :) perl -lpe'@==sort@p=map$_.shift@=,@@for@@=/,|\pL/g;$_=@p[$`]' Apparently that does the Burrows-Wheeler transform, but I don't quite see how :-/ 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: in 6.4.1, you can't check the origin of the target document while postMessage is running -- what happens if the target window is navigated to another location before the event is dispatched? as far as I can tell, the only thing you can/must do at postMessage time is determine the origin of the caller; everything else must happen immediately before the event is dispatched 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, oh, i think we could get it done in just a few lines of code even if it was http-based 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, i don't think saying ""it should be implementable in 3-10 lines of perl"" is unreasonable whatsoever c4c52ee28b65ac033f57ce478087cfd1: my vague idea was to repurpose the CONNECT method, since that is likely to already work through proxies c4c52ee28b65ac033f57ce478087cfd1: but developing the proper server-side support would be tricky so I feel like it is not worth suggesting without proof-of-concept client and server impls I think the two-way persistent connection problem may just have to get solved after HTML5 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c, well, I'm working on a proof of concept so feel free to suggest to me any ideas you have 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c, i lost connectivity there, but i had try to say that you should give me any ideas/suggestions you have for bi-directional communication protocols because I'm making a proof of concept client and server"

(heck, boot from the dvd and let it rewrite my ufs partition) That's the normal thing, yeah gday Tpenta Gman: welcome back heya jmcpAtSun Gman: how's the world of JDS? are you back in NZ yet? good good, just recovering from oscon last week in palo alto atm ah, right slept in until about 3pm, and had a walk around slacker! now going to catch up on a bit of work, and prepare for HQ next week :) muahahaha indeed walked down palo alto with my enormous gnome tshirt got a few double looks not really surprising yeah, it's a bitch being away from home eh, can't complain too much given i'm lucky enough to be travelling in the first place yeah, there is that looking forward to meeting more opensolaris dudes this week though palo alto is a bit like the set of sideways though I don't think I've seen sideways are you in Pal all week? until thursday evening sideways is that rather odd film about wine set in california hrm with Thomas Haden Church and the bloke who does a lot with Jim Carrey? <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375063/"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375063/</a> if there's an nt domain around and it's probably nt5 or better, should i try to enroll my opensolaris box into it's potential kerebros realm? :) yeah, that's the one. I have seen it timeless: possibly because you specified a naming service before that point? the solaris installer really needs an overhaul I mean it works well but could use some eye candy jmcp: yeah i specified dns especially compared to what these hacked up distros are doing these days was i not supposed to do that? jmcpAtSun, you've heard of DHCP and YP then? i'm used to things that ask me if i want to use dhcp to realize they can get dns servers from the dhcp service I think the installer is playing it safe by not assuming that your DHCP server will actually provide *all* the information that you need g4lt-U60: funnily enough, I actually have the installer could play it safe by prefillying the information from the dhcp server good god, the bletcherousness of htat simply boggles the imagination it's a good thing i have a second computer that can talk to them hrm i presume that this thing isn't going to destroy my hard drive but it hasn't asked yet :( ooh, there's the upgrade option :) i installed nexenta on a usb hard drive, then moved it into a laptop as and ide drive. now i can boot into grub but solaris can't mount the root device. what would i need to change to make this work? jmcpAtSun, no the reason that the installer exhibits that behavior is that solaris's DHCP client exhibits many levels of brokenness, like not accepting most of the inrformation from the DHCP server without manula intervention did your device name change? check your grub.conf? g4lt-U60: which is something that as long as I know about, I can work around. I've never given it a second thought yeah, but the installer by definition cannot rodrickbrown: yes it would have had to. can i use grub to manually boot the first time so i can get in to change my grub.conf? nailbags, not sure actually consult the grub doc i really have limited exp. with grub rodrickbrown: well i know how to do what i'm trying to do in linux. in linux i can press 'e' and change the boot device and the kernel command line. then boot up, enter maintinence mode to change the grub.conf and /etc/fstab, then reboot. i want to do something like that. nailbags|work: you can do that too with grub on Solaris add ""-s"" to the kernel line you'll have to futz around with the root() setting though what does -s do? boots to single user state"

I've got linear gradients pretty much implemented, working on radial now Okay, yes. I somehow skipped putting in the default value. It's 0. ok, thanks 042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427: If you want to be my hero, also do square/rectangle and diamond/rhombus radial gradients. They're really really simple once you've got everything else done. they're hard to implement actually common graphics libraries don't support them directly Really? It took me like 5 minutes to do them once I got circle and oval working. Most of it was just trying to figure out the filledRectangle syntax. we don't draw gradients with a lot of rectangles we pass them down to various native libraries Ah, I see. Damns. just started from the bottom. I suppose we could approximate squares etc with linear gradients and clipping Hmm, maybe that'll work. you really want them implemented as close to the graphics hardware as possible, for performance (gradients in general, I mean) That won't help us solve the 7th gradient-shape I wanted, though - box (shape of the box, taking into account border-radius). ;_; Though, to be honest, that's not as useful now that I don't skew the gradient. we should define a new SVG Filter for that I really just have no idea what can be done with SVG. I need to learn up on it. actually with feMorphology erode/dilate you can kind of approximate the effect the only bit of heroism I'm considering is adding -moz-repeating-linear-gradient and -moz-repeating-radial-gradient, since they'd be really easy 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: Gavin > Garrett That's a long name, but sure. I still don't like the idea of other background properties leaking into image generation. Making it explicit is better. ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: ?

What would be the effect, though, of -moz-repeating-linear-gradient(red, blue)? (Since, for a normal linear gradient, that defines a single sweep from red to blue across the entire height of the gradient.) s/height of the gradient/height of the box/ I'm in the credits? what for, I wonder oh, it's not me! 1adba86c435b5fe0f7ea043370b1636b: You're not the only person in the world called Gavin ;-) it's Gavin Carothers hate that guy Because he stole your name? yeah Good a reason as any to hate somebody 042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427: Also, I assume that -moz-repeating-linear-gradient(red -10px, blue 50px) repeats with a 60px period? yeah Hmm. Is that equivalent to linear-gradient(red -10px, blue 50px, red 110px, blue 170px, ...)? no red -10px, blue 50px, red 50px, blue 110px? it's equivalent to linear-gradient(red -10px, blue 50px, red 50px, blue 110px, ...) k, yeah. That makes better sense. so you get an abrupt transition when the starting and ending colors are not the same Yeah. but I think that's OK, it's pretty obvious what to do to get a smooth transition there Yeah, and I can put an example in the spec for it too. and you might want the abrupt transition I guess sure. Possibly more in radial - I dont' think I'd ever want it to be abrupt in linear. But there's no reason to prevent it. 1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb: a couple more questions, if I may trouble you... Go for it. ""In certain circumstances it is impossible to determine an appropriate ending-shape from the given parameters; in these instances the gradient image is just a solid color, defined by the last color-stop in the list. The following combinations of values will trigger this: closest-side if the starting-point is on a box edge, closest-corner if the starting-point is on a box corner, ellipse and closest-corner if the starting-point is on a box-edge,"" in those situations, the shape is simply a circle/ellipse with radius 0, isn't it? Yes. Which is also ""a solid color, defined by the last color-stop in the list"". ok, I suggest you rephrase ""it is impossible to determine an appropriate ending-shape"" then Hmm, okay. there' nothing really inappropriate about an empty circle or ellipse Well, it's sort of a degenerate circle. Equivalent to a point. yeah Depending on who you're talking to, degenerate shapes aren't valid. ^_^ I'll rephrase it, though. ""and finally ellipse and either closest-corner or closest-side if the starting-point is outside of the box."" I don't think we need to call out degenerate shapes in the spec, unless the spec demands behavior for the degenerate shape that is different from what you would get applying the normal rules That last one really is an error, though. There's no way to determine the dimensions of the ellipse in that case. there is suppose I'm using closest-side Unless you extend the lines defined by the sides outside of the box, I guess. right You can attempt to infer that, but I don't say anything that would make that required. I dunno if it's useful but it's what my code does I'll have to add extra code to detect the outside-box case to match the spec as written Yeah, I had to do so as well (my code didn't gracefully handle it, so it was required anyway). so I suggest changing the spec to make that the behaiour any recommendations for tutorials/demos of the canvas element and images? Hm, k. I'll see if I can do so gracefully. more specifically, i'm looking for effects. I think it probably would be useful, e.g. it means you could animate the movement of an ellipse into the box by animating the start position oh wait, that wouldn't work so I dunno :-) Nah, it'll collapse to a line as it crosses the box-edge. ^_^ I mean, you could still use it when it was outside of the box. You'd have to use color-stop positions greater than 100%, but still. I just figured using farthest-side/farthest-corner was equally useful. 042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427: Doing the animated ellipse thing would be doable relatively easily with an explicitly sized SVG gradient, and animating the background-position. yeah 1e3432d592a0aaf5feab78537496ce24: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Canvas_tutorial 1e3432d592a0aaf5feab78537496ce24: effects? 042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427: I'm heading out to do some yardwork, but I'll stay in the channel and be back later.

No wonder he's doing so well at controlling the future of the intarwebs! is <b> and <i> actually going to be left in html5? Why wouldn't they be? seems they is all ready represented by <strong> for example. And it doesn't seem to be a good example for when to use them. Or why would the specs say this: ""In the previous example, the correct element to use would have been strong, not b.""? uhm... nevermind that quote :) 86123bebfedc05009c27d1ac8f8c7411, http://lachy.id.au/log/2007/05/b-and-i f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: thanks :D f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: but given there definition how is the names of them motivated? <aside>, <article> and so on describes their intended use. How does <b> describe it's use? Or isn't that important? 86123bebfedc05009c27d1ac8f8c7411: how does b not describe it's intended use? Sorry if I'm bringing up already discussed stuff. Haven't read up on my html5 :/ So I have a problem. I have a test harness which loads testcases into an iframe. It is not impossible that those testcases will cause infinite loops or other bad behaviour so it would be nice to be able to set a timeout and kill the script if the timeout is reached Howwever this doesn't seem to be easy; the event loop seems to prioritise running the existing script above anything else. (run to completion I guess) 86123bebfedc05009c27d1ac8f8c7411, b is intended for use cases which are commenly represented typographically in bold text, but for which no specific semantic element exists 86123bebfedc05009c27d1ac8f8c7411, it would be unreasonable to have to create separate semantic elements to individually cover each of those cases, when it wouldn't gain any benefit over using the generic element Is there some way I force the source of the iframe to change before the testcase script has finished running? similarly for the i element d114be1698421a7cec050e2207d29631: from what I understand it's not intended to represent bold text but rather like f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 just wrote ""text usually written in bold"" (or close the window with the iframe in or delete the iframe or something, as long as it causes the script to die) 86123bebfedc05009c27d1ac8f8c7411, the names are retained for backwards compatibility reasons. It's best not to read too much into just the name of the element. It's the definition that matters mose f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: that explanation was good :) Not sure I'm agreeing with you but still. b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: I'm guessing that setTimeout() isn't being your friend b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, I don't know of any way to achieve that, unless perhaps setting the iframe's window.location to a new page interrupts any scripts running within the iframe f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: I got that backward compatiblility reason :) Just not a big fan of that either. 86123bebfedc05009c27d1ac8f8c7411, it's really just a matter of being pragmatic over theoretical purity f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: setting the <iframe>.src doesn't f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: have nothing to do today and haven't been reading much about html5 so I'm catching up. I'm not intending to start an argument b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, what about iframe.contentWindow.location? f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: OK I will try it 86123bebfedc05009c27d1ac8f8c7411, no worries. You've been much more pleasant and understanding than the person I debated this with over twitter 2 days ago f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: I'm not really bothered with html5 having it, but I can imagine it being missused. indeed. It will be. I'm not sure it makes any difference if it's ""misused"" the idea that <strong> is more accessible than <b> in any way is a red herring b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f: but <b> will still give bold text I assume? well, yeah just like <strong> does true they are equivalent on the vast mojority of pages except those select few which change default styling for either mutters about how badly designed the 'this' semantics are in javascript Hmm, deleting the iframe seems to work well b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f: but still, <strong> have semantic meaning while <b> doesn't. From what I understand they both have meaning * just not as clear semantic meaning then :) I'm not sure <strong> has a particularly clear meaning either it have a better meaning for me at least. But that doesn't really say anything they're basically synonyms, discussing which one is ""better"" seems to be a waste of everyone's time I seem to have acquired a stronger view on this than I used to have. :) i've developed the strong view that it just doesn't matter b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f: I'm doing my best on wasting my time on meanless stuff right now. Third day on my ""time off"" I really wish people had never used the word ""semantic"" in conjunction with the web, ""meaning"" is much less opaque and you couldn't get consturctions like ""semantic meaning"" But I'll stop bothering you now 86123bebfedc05009c27d1ac8f8c7411, without <i>, which element would you use to mark up a ship name, which is conventionally rendered in italics? f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: <title>, <name> or something similar. But yes. It would be a challange to figure out what that element should be named so you're advocating creating a new element for each case like that? even though there are potentially dozens of such cases? no, not really. Haven thought about it that much It just feels like there should be a better name for <i> then i but I guess there isn't a better name for representating traditioanlly italicised text than ""italic""? :) it seems there should ba a name for the italic ""meaning"" *should be doesn't like his new espresso.

I'm using eclipse and ""F3"" as ""go to definition"" tbsaunde: could save a couple msecs yeah 4db1d4a794c6a0e217302385866a5322: nifty davidb: it matters more when your doing the whole tree :-) yeah :) fast computers make me think less there not fast enough though we will always laugh at computers over 5 years old should make his ctags setup more reasonable I think I'm gonna fight for eclipse a little more though I'll try to do something else yet :) where are the tests? accessible/test/ or maybe accessible/tests/ ok, but I don't see python files there in bug it's mentioned to run some python script in accessible/tests/ I spot only makefiles there's a bunch of html and js too ok, and how to fire tests? the python script is just a test harness that runs the html / js in firefox easiest way is make -C objdir mchitest-a11y where from, obj-dir or moz-central? * mochitest-a11y -C for make is the dir to run in a, right should I be woried with warnings or not? like WARNING: Subdocument container has no frame: file /home/akuda/Moz/mozilla-central/layout/base/nsDocumentViewer.cpp, line 2431 well, it would be nice if you fixed them, but you didn't introduce that, so not really ok, got 1 failed test, and some TODOs. no, something failed ok, I'll dig into it ok, something weird just happened, I will report to you that in an hour, ok? sure davidb: do we have reason to believe we'll want nsRoleMapEntry::roleRule to have more values than use map role and use native role?

I'd like to have the fix for bug 693343 make it into Firefox 10--especially if 10 is going to be around for a while, it really should be included though how to backport it would kinda depend on whether 451161/705983 get included unfortunately it is not I would suggest nominating it for beta saying that you think it's important for the ESR that's more or less the only process here 81fa1e07c4ea96f215901d989f8bf37b: Okay; thanks. How do I ""nominate it for beta?"" set approval-beta? on the patch or approval-mozilla-beta or something like that 75df260141e66615dd50d0fa9e80d615: looks lke they'll be in beta, they were approved last night, and a backported patch was posted tbsaunde: heh, I would've realized that if I'd checked my email before blabbering away :) A backport should be done before requesting approval, I assume? 75df260141e66615dd50d0fa9e80d615: no need back port is probably just apply the patch I doubt that code has changed maybe ideally usually people nominate, get approval, and then realize it doesn't apply ;-) Do you then need to ask for approval again after backporting? I know the patch wouldn't apply against 8 or perhaps 9 because of PRBool -> bool changes and the like, but I don't think that applies to 10 I think that would depend how extensive the change is if I have to deal with PRBool stuff I'll just fix that before I push, I can't think of a reason that should effect approval"

Yeah, I didn't like doing that either actually, A > B > C where B can be English prose or C or Python, etc. right the charset sniffer seems to parse attributes on close tags, eg. </foo bar=""baz""> yeah tokenizer does that too does the tokenizer parse them then throw them away? yes phew :) what I meant about the spec is that the description is actually lower level than the code it's easier to implement a high level spec with low level code than the reverse. hmm isn't the spec at the same level? charset sniffing needs to be done at the byte level I mean it's very imperative the spec is longer than your python implementation, for example and much harder to understand so how can it be done in the same way being as exact as it is now? if it can be improved I suppose it should be done that's what I'm trying to figure out using regular expressions would be an obvious place to start and it's easy to see how that could be done for most of it for example: <![^>]*> that's the regular expression to match <!DOCTYPE...> and similar junk and skip over it similarly for comments: <!--([^-]|-[^-]|--[^>])*--> defining it using a regular expression means that there is no ambiguity about <!--> vs. <!---> vs. <!----> start tags and get attribute are a little trickier, but I think can still be done to match the beginning of a start tag: </?[A-Za-z][^\s><]* (or end tag, as it has an optional slash) the resulting regular expressions could just about be pasted straight into lex or perl or whatever however, it makes it harder to introduce <!--> as comment very easy, just change the regular expression much easier than editing the prose actually, the expression I pasted before is a little bit too strict if you're going down that route you have to define what subset of regular expressions and such... <!--([^-]|-+[^>])*--> would be better prefers the prose actually that's not a problem, many many specifications use standard subset of regular expressions or BNF oh well :) regular expressions also encourages a particular implementation which isn't necessarily good meeting hmm, I think the current prose is more biased towards a particular implementation whereas regular expressions can be implemented directly, or used as specification for hand written parser ahah, regular expression for attributes: [\s/]*([^<>][^=\s/<>]*)[\s]*=[\s]*('[^']*'|""[^""]*""|[^\s<>]*) it may look like line noise, but you don't have to be an en-GB-x-Hixie speaker to understand it :)"

What am I doing wrong? d1b52ef1e322a9f557e7544ae1385990 : it is the logical way if the child would have 0.5, actually it will show like it was 0.25 fb23a69ae45317b123262e6ea8db6369: How can I make it totally non-opaque? Set it to a 1.50? (since the parent is 0.5) hehe, actually, you can't like this why are you using opacity, is it only for background ? It is the for the background of the border div-box :P You can see it on: d1b52ef1e322a9f557e7544ae1385990.dk the box that has the Redesign in it shouldn't be see-through consider using rgba() ? How? background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); for instance That'd fix it? well it will help you to not use opacity but opacity is also for text, so it depends on what you really want I do NOT want opaque text :) ok, so that's your solution d1b52ef1e322a9f557e7544ae1385990: consider using Modernizr it will help you to detect if rgba() is supported or not Yeah, that did it! Thanks a lot :) What is it? Plugin or? a promoted js library a lib http://www.modernizr.com/ Thanks :) But doesn't rgba work in opera, ff, chrome & safari? it will let you do something like html.rgba .div-box { background: rgba(...) } html.no-rgba .div-box { background: #FFF; } Ohh, cool!

I'm thinking about upgrading to 2010 (for some other side projects of mine), and I want to make sure that it won't break any mozilla functionality. b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee: wel, its been a while but I'm pretty sure there's alot of people who build with it err, while since I've built on !linux I see that it can compile on express edition. So i take it that FF doesn't use any ATL or MFC. Because you can't get those in express versions. correct, it does not I think Microsoft should also come out with a command line only version of the visual C++ compiler, like linux has gcc. Unless they do, and I don't know it. I hate that you have to install the whole graphical IDE just to get the compiler. 898fc6ecff9a5867e6455f37fba81580: Ping b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee: pong 898fc6ecff9a5867e6455f37fba81580: I wanted to help out on bug 335718. You made a comment on there saying that you had worked on some code for it. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=335781 Yeah a log time ago, I have no idea where that patch went 898fc6ecff9a5867e6455f37fba81580: Ha ha. No prob then. I did look for it recently but to no avail, which is strange, could have sworn I kept it around somewhere McBride is the new owner of the addons right? yep OK. I dropped him an email last night. So hopefully he will respond soon. I've been wanting the same functionality explained in this bug. :p As a rough idea, you have to have the search engine manager component call AddonManagerPrivate.registerProvider and supply it with an object that implements all the methods expected Ok. Where does the search engine manager component live? Here is some example code that I wrote a while ago to do that that may be a good resource. It is a little outdated but many of the methods are the same: http://www.oxymoronical.com/blog/2010/07/How-to-extend-the-new-Add-ons-Manager 898fc6ecff9a5867e6455f37fba81580: Thanks http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/search/nsSearchService.js Thanks again. :0 :) I'll start looking into this bug. ooh hang on b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee: During the development of Firefox 4 when I wrote the initial search engine stuff we were working in a different mercurial repository. Looks like the changes I made are still in there so with a bit of digging you could probably put together a rough idea of what the changes were, see all the changesets here with my name on them; http://hg.mozilla.org/projects/addonsmgr/log/11169b0f10ab/tool kit/components/search/nsSearchService.js Wonderful! I'll take a look at this. Maybe just comparing this version of that file with the current version in mozilla-central would tell you a lot: http://hg.mozilla.org/projects/addonsmgr/log/11169b0f10ab/toolkit/components/search/nsSearchService.jshttp://hg.mozilla.org/projects/addonsmgr/log/11169b0f10ab/toolkit/components/search/nsSearchService.js Yeah, it will guide me in the right direction. So basically, this javascript code is what allows you to change search providers on the search box? Again, a little outdated so will be in need to tinkering with but should get you a long way That code and some other code somewhere that handles the actual UI element Ok gavin is the owner of the search engine stuff so you may also want to chat with him at some point once you've got a good idea of how you're doing it Sounds great. b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee: some of the thunderbird search stuff might help too: http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/mail/base/content/webSearchTab.js it's definitely more recent than the firefox stuff, anyway b9477d3127c5eb606e60a7271f68029f: Cool.

No SLED exists hm, nope, wiking ^^ new_suse_user: that is, because SLED has support via formal channels. phone, email etc.. ok new_suse_user: and if you pay for it, novell has the obligation to provide you support, that's their businness. well, I haven't paid for it. At least not yet. I'm on the two month trial. Nobody's asked me for my activation code yet new_suse_user: are you looking for update repos or default install repos? he wants update repos, which i dont think you can get without buying it and having a novell login like sles, but i am not positive on that spin's right. But I'm sure they'll let me use them on the evaluation. lol why are you sure of that? SLES doesnt work that way because SLED is behind open 10.1 out-of-the-box SLES 10 is also based on suse 10.1"

Does anyone know if it's actually implementable? 7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6: it's what has happened in the decade I've been involved time and again, but sure, nothing is certain 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: Opera implemented it, I believe edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e, i'm looking forward to vorbis support then. in 2017, when i don't need it anymore, because the mp3 patents ‚Ä¶ hmm. probably are still going to be out there somewhere, lurking. time for mickey mp3 laws in the end Microsoft ships a browser like anyone else, and browsers are driven a lot by what developers want, and they want browsers to work the same way edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e, if large inconsistencies like CSS weirdness and media formats happen to work for them, i do not believe small inconsistencies have any chance unless they actually drive it. they might not move as fast as the others, but they have <canvas> now, they have full CSS 2.1 support, etc. well, at least there's some evidence that they're willing to make breaking changes to their own legacy compat (eg. read-only event objects) funny, developers i know constantly tell me browsers are driven by what browser companies want. that is some nice loop ;D all the things we thought were not going to happen back when we started with the WHATWG in 2004 IE has <canvas>? wow. long time no see. so maybe I'm pretty optimistic, but there's some history to support it edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: supporting new features and breaking existing ones are different classes, though; i don't think adding support for Canvas is evidence for making breaking changes (though as I said, there's at least some evidence for that) edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e, you may be right after all, because killing off UTF-32 slowly is almost as good as killing it off fast. it's been 7 years of WHATWG? That deserves a ""wow"" of its own. :) so it might not matter if they care much, if they do at all. 06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6: the HTML parser was a breaking change 06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6: CSS 2.1 was a breaking change 06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6: a lot of things were breaking changes, for pretty much every browser we've had those modulo quirks mode, though (though I pretty much ignore the details of that, being fortunate enough to not have horrible legacy stuff to maintain) ah yeah, IE10 breaks its own quirks mode! to be more compatible with the other browsers that should be a good sign that UTF-32 will go away :) dunno, as always we'll see :) far from the biggest problem plaguing charsets, so I'm not chewing my fingernails over it either way IE10 implements appcache? I thought that was broken and no one wants to use it. I think everyone just wants more out of it (to put it somewhat simply) http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/trunk/experimental.socket.html :( http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/webkit/glue/webkit_glue.cc?r1=111877&r2=111876&pathrev=111877 I love open-source: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=73182 would spoofing as ""User-Agent: you're an idiot"" be acceptable perhaps it would help get the message across 06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6, i like your style and wish to subscribe to your newsletter. I think it's right here, in #whatwg :) // Pretend to be Firefox. Silverlight doesn't support Win Safari. someone please patch WebKit to remove UTF-32 for me tonight ahaha oh wow nn nn nn?

You could use something like Mechanical Turk to farm the work out a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9, the alternative is to simply send the offending person an email virus or perform a DOS attack on them or should we setup virtualkneecap.com? I suppose a DOS attack is similar to kneecapping, in online terms f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: RELAX NG has been around since 2000 or so. .. problem was that nobody involved with HTML did much with it until 2006 or so, when fantasai (and then hsivonen) started work on whattf schema for HTML5 & WF2 a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2, yes, but there's also the stigma attatched to the DTD as being the only official validation method endorsed by the spec, and alternative validators using different techniques and which didn't strictly adhere to the spec were seen as inferior even if their results were more useful in practice, like claiming unimplemented SGML shorthand features were invalid never even heard of any HTML validators other than validator.w3.org f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: if such sentiment exists, better to just ignore it it without comment ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: we have this thing called validator.nu ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c, http://validator.w3.org/docs/help.html#others v.nu represents a corruption of the ideals there are other ones too, but I can't remember their names or URLs a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2, HTML5 in general represents a corruption of many people's ideals And of idealism in general :) HTML5 is an abomination it's ironic that 4 or 5 years ago, I shared the ideals of many who are complaining about HTML5 today. Though I've since been corrupted myself :-) f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: that is a sign that you beliefs are changed to easily next year, you'll believe something different a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2, no, changing my beliefs is never easy. I'm really quite stubborn you? stubborn? I can't believe it yes. Don't you think so? no, you are the most reasonable person in the world you should get a special aware award? the Tactful and most Thougtfully Considered Opinions Award I wanted to win the Smeghead award too bad a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: I mean, before I was involved with HTML5 I'd never even heard of any HTML validators other than validator.w3.org although I didn't think ""smeg"" referred to a kind of cheese http://lastweekinhtml5.blogspot.com/2009/01/bonnie-prince-cheesie.html ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: that's of course because there are none or were none before hsivonen appeared f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: Mr Last Week clearly wants to have sex with you with you in particular so you can choose to accept that and make it happen, or you what?! can politely decline read between the lines, genius Or he can lie, merely using it as a tool to figure out the secret identity of you-know-who I'm sure we'll figure out the identity of Mr Last Week one day. There's no rush though f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: your IQ is clearly greater than that of former US President George W.

I priced out a DVDRW on a Thinkpad T-42 and IBM wants more than $439 dollars for the thing. This is outrageous. I am not convinced it is worth it because you can buy one for under $200 in a Dell. Does anyone feel differently? You might be able to find slim drives on Newegg that will fit. I looked on Newegg and I couldn't find anything. However, that doesn't mean they aren't there. IBM is outrageously expensive and the conclusion I came to is that if the warranty ever lapses, the laptop is worthless and probably unsellable. Parts are just too high. ""Lenovo"". I guess I should get my termination right. #thinkpad #ibmthinkpad So far I have not been able to find either a slim drive or generic batteries and the conclusion I came to is IBM it outrageously expensive -- worth than apple. Why not get a firewire fullsize burner? If you wish, you could even get one that can be made region-free. What do you mean by region free? Play DVDs from other countries. I am exploring the possibility of selling my computer and buying a new one that is hopefully a less expensive brand than IBM. I haven't made up my mind. I am not convinced that Thinkpads are worth the extra money. They are too expensive. I bought mine used and haven't had it very long, but I would rather have a system that ha duo core, DVD burner, and maybe a little bit bigger hard drive. (Though I'm biased) I like HP. What is different in HP that you like. Hopefully they are less expensive. Thinkpads are ridiculously expensive. The Mac is cheaper. What version of the HP are you using or do you like? IBM seems to have good anti-shock and anti-roll features, but they are behind the times when it comes to using backup CDs with DVD. They are still pushing CDRW which is technologically obsolete for backing up your drive -- unless you want to put in 13 or more disks. Well it is time for me to go to sleep. See you all in the morning. Well, I like the deals HP gives on hardware. This current machine is a Gateway -- it was a gift/scholarship, so I didn't argue brand)"

(presumably he didn't have a logical and technical refutation to mjs' points) ok, I'll search their emails ooh, so is Gareth leaving the group? ""Fine. I think today will be my last day on the list. "" so it seems I should explain to him that his arguments were dismissed on technical, logical and practical grounds, and that he should not take it to heart. he says he's a newcomer, and so he needs to understand that there are a lot of people with significantly more experience than him, but that doesn't mean his feedback isn't welcome he just needs to be prepared think about issues, listen to others and learn. he already said he was clearly wrong... Which objections against XForms? I have enough knowledge of XForms to know that it isn't based on HTML4 and isn't based at all on HTML4 or the XML version of HTML4 forms. f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: actually, I think John Boyer was referring to Anne--not mjs I think so too But I was more asking because I know it to be more complex because of the separation between controls and data and such"

FWIW 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e's accept/reject rate is still around 50% of the non-garbage bugs (where by ""garbage"" I mean duplicate or invalid) I looked at some past months and the rate seems to be slowly going down over time the highest I found was 70% as in i'm rejecting more? that seems like pretty much whatI would expect for a maturing spec yes, you seem to be rejecting more percentage-wise than in, say, July i'd expect the rate to go the other way, actually, because the problems should be getting more trivial (e.g. reviewers should be moving from ""this doesn't work"" to ""this is misspelt"") well some reviewers are still submitting requests for new features there might be a better correlation of rate vs reporter than rate vs time but you're right, I could imagine it going the other way if the proportion of editorial issues was increasing as one might expect possible - I did not try to measure that cause it would be too much work :-)"

Echelon-H: I don't think you need any special support as long as you use the latin alphabit. arrummzen, and how can I do that? pcb1962: wlan0 Interface doesn't support scanning. Echelon-H: what alphabit does Hebrew normaly use? arrummzen, it's own Hebrew alphabet... If it doesn't use Latin by default, you will have to find out what the standard conventions for typeing Hebrew in Latin are. arrummzen, it's not based on latin or something... hmm, that's not good I know there is some kind of standard for typeing Greek langauge in the Latin (rather than Greek) alphabit. two questions, a. since I have taken out frame buffer support in my kernel, following the ati wiki, is there a way to set it up so I do have giant text at startup? and b. is it ok to set up support for two different audio devices in my kernel? pcb1962: ifconfig doesnt shows any wlan0 interface.. should it? Echelon-H: Is its special alphabit part of the unicode standard? wsjunior - have you done 'modprobe ndiswrapper'? meeseontheleese: no, you have to have a framebuffer to have anything but the default text arrummzen, think so, yeah pcb1962: yes Anyone else notice that /usr/kde/3.3 and 3.4 hang around after KDE 3.5 is upgraded to and the earlier ones are unmerged? None of the files belong to any packages. ifconfig -a should show wlan0 cc is treating warnings as errors, and is therefore failing to compile several packages... my make.conf and error is posted at <a href=""http://pastebin.com/766115"">http://pastebin.com/766115</a> how do i fix this? i do not know what to google Ryan, crap, then how do I set it up a again? I know you go into device support, graphic support but do you put support for frame buffer as a module or just include it? Ive tried both, and they dont seem to work Echelon-H: hmmm... did you build your system with unicode support (ig with ""unicode"" in your USE flags)? arrummzen, i think so. that was you rayn, also, can is it alright to put support for two different sound drivers in my kernel? Echelon-H: in all honesty, I am not sure XTerm suports anything but ascii, I know konsole (the kde terminal emulator) supports i18l. or i18n or whatever the acryonym is. pcb1962: no it doesnt shows it"

I'm trying to install ANY OS on it, I've tried *BSD, Linux, and even windows, and it has boot problems. Basically, it will not boot into any OS after installation. It prompts me to insert a boot disk, because none were recognised. I have everything hooked up correctly, but it still has problems. Anybody? Is it set to boot off cd, and nothing else? scsi, ide, or sata? tjousk: oops sorry it took me so long. No, it is set to boot off HD-0 first, and then CDROM. It's an IDE drive. anyone here use trillian? Yup. Used to oh ChefWill: I used it many years ago.. there seems to be a big bug in it hi hi whenever someone else messages me that is using trillian itll crash me and if i message him it crashes him Yep. There always is. Grab Gaim. but only the first time we start a chat gaim for windwos sucks hmm. Just with a particular user, a particular network, or what? yep, but it's better than nothing.

Pretty much, but if you are going to buy it, you expect it to be done right. neonfreon1: got any input on my issue above? neonfreon1: not the trillian one, but the HD one? it boots off of CD but not your HD? neonfreon1: Yep. I've set the HD in bios, but it still doesn't even recognise it as a bootable device. dragonfyre13: sounds like you need a bios update or an RMA dragonfyre13: or to test the drive in another computer Triffid_Hunter: Holy shit it worked. yeah sounds like an HD issue to me I just tried to replace the IDE cable, once again, and apparently the five before that were all bad. I replaced it with a one that I had in the box still from like a year ago. dragonfyre13: dd if=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1 | hexdump <-- last two bytes should be 55 aa for the drive to be seen as bootable I cannot believe that that did it. dragonfyre13: lol bad cable eh.. that'll do it every time :/ Oh, and I did that, but thanks a bunch Triffid_Hunter I figured that one out after playing with fdisk for a while, and it not giving me the info that I wanted. I hate my cables. ^_^ Thanks guys.

I went back to the printer setup and I think it said it was using a lexmark z22 driver so i tried to print a page, and nothing I can get it to work again cant* any ideas? sounds like a linux problem I tried rebooting my system with the printer plugged it in* have you tried in windows I dont really do windows, but yeah it works with windows in the past it has anyway lexmark eh.. get a HP, they provide linux drivers i dont really have that option lexmark are the ones who tried to sue everyone making cheaper ink refills iirc yeah i dont really like lexmark, but its all i have to work with did you read your distro's guide on setting up printers? yeah, I'm pretty sure i have it set up right shane_: checked linuxprinting.org ? linux printing is way too hard for some reason if it works in windows and not and linux it's almost defintely a setup issue heh tell me about it.. my oki 4w only prints the top half of the page on a good day :/ one thing that looks suspicious is that in the printing diologue, it shows the status as ""Ready:Processing page 2..."" well i got it to feed another page with the z22 driver still nothing on the page though i'd try some forum somewhere you're dealing with a linux problem, and this is #hardware no offense, but you're not likely to get much help here ok just figured that printer problems fit in with hardware but thanks for the help printer problems do, but your printer works :) hey, on the intel arch., when i want to access the PCI bus or a PCI device, I set the address of the PCI bus/device to be accessed on port 0xCF8, right? and then access the PCI bus/device data on 0xCFC? try #osdev Vratha"

But I think I can leave most of what I fixed in. yeah but still back out the change removing -moz-float-edge: margin-box from li"

But I constantly see people asking how to reset their browser to the right zoom level. I use zoom shortcuts too, but would it really hurt to have them less accessible? Like Ctrl-Shift-mouse wheel or something? this is why Opera disables single key shortcuts by defaults - they are too easy to hit by accident its easy to be using ctrl for something and hit the scroll wheel by accident Oh, it does that for all single-key shortcuts? I recall it requires Shift-Esc or something for accesskeys, which always struck me as inconvenient. theres an option that simply re-enables single key shortcuts, like z for back and x for forward I remember when Opera had a single-key shortcut for turning images on and off, it was bloody annoying :) Oh, so we were talking about double-key shortcuts, not single-key. Backspace is an annoying shortcut. I find it more annoying that my firefox doesn't have that shortcut 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 - strongly agreed, backspace is a very annoying shortcut. really wish I could disable that have lost content too many times due to that shortcut I've used backspace on a laptop before, when I didn't have a mouse with back/forward buttons. The back button on my current mouse hasn't worked for a long time, though, and I mostly just click the back button when I want to go back. should look into that. e.g. you think you're focused in a text field, and want to delete characters you just typed, but it turns out the ""document"" has focus, and then backspace/delete goes back, and loses your textarea edits. your browser doesn't remember the field contents? wishes he could patch is browsers to *not* treat backspace/delete as ""go back"" in navigation. Steve^ depends on if the page was the result of a form submit etc. then if you try to go forward, you get asked, do you want to resubmit? etc. = dataloss or worse, AJAX hacks to edit content that don't recover from back/forward Anyway, one of my first MediaWiki commits was removing an annoying shortcut. https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8203 apart from the AJAX wizardry, your browser doesn't account for form submit pages? f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905, well, if you use an open-source browser, you can! 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 - not without lots of work recompiling and merging with updates. Probably wouldn't have to do much work merging with updates, just recompiling. It's unlikely those lines would get changed often. But, yeah, just saying. Maybe I'll just point out that Opera has none of these problems, without you patching the browser? might be simpler in the short-term seems to me like shortcuts should be in a separate config file anyway Yeah, every game out there lets you change all your shortcuts -- why not browsers too? I'd be fine even with a ""defaults write com.apple.webkit ... "" type solution (for webkit, firefox etc.) Opera has a handy keyboard shortcut editing dialog so you can disable backspace there if you want ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c - nice - thanks I'll check that out. (in Preferences/Advanced/Shortcuts) hmm, Philip stealing my ideas! So, <video> replaces flash on the ipad. What's going to replace PDFs? Who wants to replace PDFs? i.e, when are we going to able to print properly from the net? PDF is a standard format, why do you need to replace it? doesn't work on my phone Just use a different implementation if you don't like Adobe's. if its a matter of time for it to get to all devices, then that's probably ok I assumed it was more of a royalty deal or implementation problem PDF can be implemented royalty-free. And is. There's already lots of reader and writer implementations Tons of programs support it. does Android have one? My phone has a pdf reader installed by default. I've never used it though :p thought HTML+CSS was supposed to replace the need for PDF. ;) f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905, that's what you'd expect, but you can't print from the web - I can't do my CV in HTML Steve^, why not? it's ideal in that you can format exactly how you want and yet the browsers let you down I've done a resume in HTML before. remembers helping to write some pretty damn good print (including print preview and size/image tweaking) in IE5/Mac ~ 10 years ago.

Steve^ re: CV in HTML: http://microformats.org/wiki/hresume I'm speaking from experience in trying to get something I know will print to 2 pages ok, Opera printing a full-screen CV document: the right margin is about 3 inches wide same as the bottom ooo, chrome does a pretty good job I dont' think I've tried printing my resume before, I just send it around as a link.

I'll throw it out here and pop in and out to see if it's generated any response since you all might be away, etc. problem: browsing websites with images enabled is much slower than with them disabled, but how can a web designer/developer tell the browser which images are important and which are unimportant to the content? possible solution ./ idea: a microformat that web developers can use to hint to the browser which ones to show. a Firefox/browser extension would pick up the microformat info and show those, leaving the rest on the server and not requested conclusion: browsing would be snappier on these web sites (especially on low-performance machines) while still showing the most important images in the content, etc. possible solution / alternate: the same effect may be done with a browser extension and, instead of a microformat, using the z-index to decide priority of the images but I'm not sure if that really applies as z-index does not equal priority in POSH just throwing out ideas simply: instead of ""load images on sites"" being a boolean, I'd like to see it be ""load only high priority images on sites"" to help speed up browsing, reduce bandwidth use, etc."

So it MUST be ""draft-holsten-about-uri-scheme-03"" if you want to update -02 sorry that's fine The name must be identical except for the number. Otherwise it won't be processed as update ok.

non-predator,ee7e11ded2c0b31d8027016af481190c,"Hixie: the EcmaScript committee is currently discussing the possible addition of a new script-related tag to handle backward-compatible breaks in the language. Hixie: something like <script-if type=""application/ecmascript;version=6""> // new.js inline-exanded here </script-if else> <script ...> </script> </script-if end> I believe it needs discussing with them. Is that a serious proposal? I thought everyone was trying to move _away_ from inline script looks ugly also, they already have stuff like use strict Could simply add another ""use if-less-than 6"" to old.js If people have to write both new.js and old.js, why don't they just write old.js and always use that and be done with it? Maybe new.js is faster wonders if the plan is to break compatibility in order to replicate the massive success of Python 3.0 https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es-discuss/2011-May/014810.html I think I kind of prefer syntax that is possible to represent with the DOM ""We discussed generating script tags via document.write conditioned by object detection and the like"" In the follow-up email Oh, that'd surely be a much better solution this is weird shit Presumably, you would need <script-if type=""application/ecmascript;version=6""><!-- code -->...

Ahem Age, sex, and location, please? OMG I CAN'T BELIVE YOU ASKED ME THAT HOW RUDE!!! APOLOGIZE! Ahaha. Apologies, kind sir, ma'am, or other. >:-( Apologize. Now. Thank you. So how are you, Stranger? I had a disappointing day, but overall my life is an easy one. So, I'd say that I'm... hm... pretty good. :-( how was your day disapointing stranger?!? :-( People with easy lives, like me, are allowed less right to complain, but we have it all the same. Well, it began yesterday. yes. See, one of my best friends was in town, so I (ever so kindly) asked my father if I could go over to his house tomorrow (that being today) hmmm.... He approved. So, when today came, I was rather excited to see my friend who I do not get to see often. ummhmmm.... *jots down notes* Then, about 3 minutes before I was going to walk out the door and to the car, my father says ""No."" Rather flatly. I turn. ""No?"" OH NO HE DIDNT! ""You can't go out today."" he says. :-o why? Well, his reasoning was as follows: ""You were late to school today."" However ohhh.... :-/ He decided it would be just ever so much fun if he were to not move his car out of the way of mine In the morning And then blame it on me. Well, thats not right at all.... Hah, but things happen, I suppose. I'm generally an optimist. I've been told that I don't look the part of an optimist, but... well, I am. Look the part? My disposition is often seen as negative. oohhh.... I get it... I wear black, often. Not *all* black. Black pants make me cringe. Wouldn't touch 'em. Let alone wrap my nether regions in them. I enjoy scary stories. :-o Then again, I also enjoy Spongebob. So who knows what kind of person I am. Scary...*gulp*... STORIES.. I LOVE SPONGBOB@ We getting married. You are invited to our wedding I enjoy a lot of things that I am considered ""too old for"". Ooh. A wedding. I've been to a few. When I was younger. Yes, yes! Forced to dance with cousins. Embarassing. :- / ew your cousins? Yes. To Hot-Blooded by Foreigner, no less. ah hu Hm. What else do I enjoy? ABRAHAM LINCON! I like gory movies, but also Pokemon. :-| I Actually, yes. Love Pokemon My favorite is Haunter. Articuno is my favorite legendary. In fiction, I find myself preferring things of the Ice element. I like umm the one that sits in the egg.. Togepi? YES TOGEPI! Eggsecute? i cant never remember there names.... I remember a large majority of the first two generations of Pokemon. Togepi was my first pokemon card :-) The third and fourth generations never quite drew me in like the first two did. Hm... I wonder, what was my first? I can only remember the really populare ones Uh... it might have been Ancient Mew that started my collection. :-o really? Thats my brothers favorite... Unfortunately, most of my cards are lost and gone forever. I still play the games actively, though. but alas i gave all my pokemon cards to my little sister *exept my favorites* .... Currently going through SoulSilver. Given careful consideration, I think that it and HeartGold might be the best games in the series. I am horrible at those games.... I can never win. :-( Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Diamond, Pearl, Platinum... never quite enthralled me like Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Gold, Silver, and Crystal did. You can't? :o What is usually the problem? no my older brother can I m just not capable. I always die.... whenever i battle :- / oh well I enjoy the first two Pokemon movies. They began to lose me with the third movie. well pokemon loving stranger, I must abid you faitwell because, because ... well becaus eit is bedtime bet let it be know you are the coolest omegler in ther history of forever....

non-predator,cbe2b36cc9a4436081d6137a77668f02,"Why is HTMLPropertiesCollection.namedItem a caller and a getter? erlehmann, although you aren't here anymore: I'd hazard a guess that implementers like free licenses because it means the W3C has no control over the specs in the end, which means the implementers will have de facto control. Non-implementers will have no control over the spec outside the W3C. Also, one or two of the implementers are ideologically committed to open-source type stuff, which practically no companies are. What's this survey that the Team submitted to the AC that Maciej mentioned? Hmm, visited links on this W3C page are lighter than unvisited links. How incredibly confusing. Oh, is this it? http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/doclic201105/ yes Oh, the Intel AC rep is Wayne Carr? Like, the guy who said we shouldn't adopt free licenses because it will allow dictators to suppress their citizens' Internet access? That's a shame. wtf? oh, are you referring to his comments about governements forking the spec and stuff? Yeah. oh, yeah. Perhaps he doesn't realise that governements can and do pass crazy laws all the time without forking specs That is one possibility Seriously, what stake does Intel have in HTML5 anyway? Pentiums make the web faster, if I remember the adverts Then they should have left the W3C when they stopped making Pentiums, surely? There are a large number of Members with no obvious stake in the web ]I assume that is why W3C does so many non-Web things Which is why it's kind of a puzzle how they get to run the W3C. Or really it's not, it's because they give the W3C money. keeps the AC survey results open in a tab to look at occasionally as they progress, although being unable to talk about them publicly is kind of annoying 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762, it's useful to keep such members in the W3C even if they have no obvious stake in current specifications, since a) the W3C gets membership fees from them, and b) such companies with large patent portfolios continue to be bound by the patent policy They're only bound by the patent policy for WGs that they're members of. But even non-HTMLWG members are voting on the HTML5 license. So that part is weak. Intel is a WG member I know. That's how Wayne Carr answered the HTMLWG survey. As for (a), maybe if the W3C were less bureaucratic, it wouldn't need so much money. Or maybe implementers would be willing to pay more of the bill if they were the ones that controlled the organization. they need to cover operational costs somehow. What's the W3C's budget? A few tens of millions of dollars, probably? That would be a pretty small burden if split between Microsoft, Apple, and Google. Plus they could get rid of a lot of the operational costs if they didn't have to have decision-making structures independent of implementer consensus. All companies have a stake in the web to the extent that they are heavy users of it and benefit from improvements to the platform - I assume that's largely why Google started Chrome (they're not doing it to sell an OS, they're doing it to drive progress in the technology their business depends on) but other companies that haven't bothered doing their own browser development may have a similar desire for improvements To be fair giving even more control to those with the deepest pockets doesn't sound like a winning move It's not about deep pockets, it's about market share. Mozilla has very shallow pockets compared to Apple or Google, but it has more clout in web standards. Look at WebSQL. Apple+Google+Opera = more money than Microsoft+Mozilla, but nowhere close to enough market share to make it tenable to ignore them, so they lose."

Also, that IDL itself doesn't parse, but that's a separate issue. it's abarth's Google Docs document converted to HTML by me I might have made some mistakes interface [Replaceable] URL { That looks like it's not your mistake. :) (easily fixable, though) ah, cool, it exists now if you've filed a bug on me to update the html spec to point to that spec, thanks I think that spec should eventually define Syntax/Parsing/Model/API I did, yeah. for URLs I didn't give the spec URL, though. So if I'm testing that document.body is an HTMLBodyElement and document.head is an HTMLHeadElement, does it make sense to repeat all the tests for Node/Element/HTMLElement for both objects? (for instance) That means they'd all be run once for every interface that extends HTMLElement. Since I'm testing one of each element type. That seems like a lot of repetition. It seems like it makes more sense to only do the tests for the bottommost interface if I've tested the higher ones, at least for most of the element types. 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: Yeah, having huge numbers of tests that every HTML*Element is also an Element is just a waste of entropy And that it's an HTMLElement, and a Node. Indeed However, we do want to test that both Document and Text are Nodes, for instance. So I'll have to make it configurable somehow. Oh, so things like WindowBase64 are so that workers can implement them too, right? Interesting. will have to support that 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: re your mail about my crappy checkin comments, I've added a line to the checkin comment that lists the affected topics 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: it won't be perfect, certainly at first where a lot of the time it'll just say ""Affected topics: HTML"" 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: but it's a start 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, is it on the first line? If not, it won't be visible to anyone reading commit-watchers unless they look at the actual e-mail instead of just the subject. last line. If I make it the first line it'll be the only thing in the e-mail subject. For non-editorial changes, you can usually figure out the general subject from the first line of the commit summary. yeah As I said, it's not a big deal for me, I just glance at all of them. You know what's fun? When my tests call alert() with no arguments because that's supposed to throw, and WebKit doesn't throw but instead alerts the empty string, interrupting the tests. . . . then it hangs. I wonder what the last method it called was. window.open is fun too. (""pop-up blocked"") sort of need browser help to test some stuff properly... eg. a (restricted) api to fire keyboard/mouse input as if it was real user input, replace modal things (alert, file pickers) with a callback, that sort of thing i assume browsers do all that for their internal testing anyway HTML defines interface Function? o_O WTF? that predates WebIDL, i think. As far as I know, though, WebIDL still doesn't provide a type equivalent to that Function interface. heycam: what's the new way to describe [Supplemental] in WebIDL?

Hello, my friendly QT channel. moin pat I have a little question I hope someone of you can answer. I'm currently using QT 4.1.1. I have a QListView with several items in it. I use single-selection mode. I want to change some other widgets value when the selection changes. I tried the activated() signal and the clicked() signal. activated seems to only work on double click (on a mac, atleast). clicked works on clicked. But I saw that if I click on a item, but do not release the mouse button and drag the cursor u is there some way I can guarantee that the widgets I need to update are always in-sync with the selection in the QListView? ... I guess I can subclass the QListView and overwrite selectionChanged() pat, you might implement an item...() event for ALL the events to see which ones activate under what circumstances... i'm dealing with this same issue myself gah. I'm fighting with qmake again. is having a class inherit from both a Q3CanvasItem and QObject not allowed? I am getting problems with the generated moc_... ah, it makes a difference which is listed first in the inheritance... overwriting selectionChanged() works great :) does anyone understand coordinate mapping for pop-up menus? i've got a menu popup appearing in the upper corner of my desktop and it should be in the upper corner of my widget and i'm unclear on how to get it remapped <a href=""http://doc.trolltech.com/4.1/qwidget.html#mapFromGlobal"">http://doc.trolltech.com/4.1/qwidget.html#mapFromGlobal</a> <a href=""http://doc.trolltech.com/4.1/qcursor.html#pos"">http://doc.trolltech.com/4.1/qcursor.html#pos</a> am I going the right way with subclassing a QListView in regard to the Designer with right clicking on the QListView, selecting 'Promote to Custom Widget'? The resulting application works fine and looks like I expected it, but it looks a ""bit"" wrong in Designer itself. my experience with promoting is that designer doesn't always paint the promoted widgets as it should but I guess there is no better way of doing it, right? ie it can sometimes show, say, a qlabel subclass in a way that is clearly wrong not that i know of, at least not anything as simple well, it looks like it got the layouting all wrong. yup but when you try the real thing it usually works as it should yeah, it does still sucks ;) it even works correct when previewing.. of course you can make your class into a proper designer component seems to much work for overwriting one method yup :) but thank you :) I can atleast stop searching for a simple solution and live with it. programming tip #244: when in doubt, RTFM!!! marloshome: heh, works quite often i guess it's too early in the am for completely rational thought"

non-predator,dd1bb045c268fe0d2ee2fb8c32a1cd26,"hsivonen_, you e-mailed public-html with this: ""HTML 5 seeks to make layout tables non-conforming, which I think it is an exercise in futility."" I've been thinking about defining what a layout table is in terms of which elements and attributes it does and does not use, so they could be told apart from data tables automatically hsivonen_, something like ""If a table contains <th>, scope or headers it is a data table. Otherwise it is a layout table."" layout tables which match the description for layout tables would be conforming; layouts tables which include <th>, scope or headers would not be conforming 42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9: Looking for accessibility markup as a hint is nice in theory (it's the approach WCAG 1.0 was geared towards); I'm not sure it works that well in practice. (That is, I'm not sure how consistently data tables use any of that markup.) FWIW I think JAWS used to assume that outer tables were layout tables and inner tables were data tables. (when all it had was td anyhow) Given IE8's support for CSS table display properties, I'm not clear what the authoring advantages of layout tables would be anymore. support legacy content and authoring convenience spring to mind so long as HTML5 defines how UAs treat layout tables, do you reckon people care about the conformance of legacy content? I meant making legacy content work with ATs by having one interoperable method of detecting layout tables But that's not a conformance issue for authors; that's a conformance issue for UAs. Is that what we're talking about? If so, I hadn't realized HTML5 was insisting UAs treat table as data; that indeed wouldn't be very wise. If *not, I mean http://sitesurgeon.co.uk/tables/ - 45% of the data tables I found don't use <th>; 35% use <td> for all their headers without scope or headers. telling authors their layout tables or data tables are broken seems useful for a checker Yes. so there would be requirements for authors to follow the definitions and UAs to detect which tables fit which definition I'm not sure I can see authors combing over old table layouts to turn them into conforming layout tables. ""Outer tables can never be data tables."" could be part of the definition I'd have thought it would be more useful to have a validator mode for checking all non-conforming markup is in a state that should ""work"". *more precise the definition of layout tables would be informed by research into how they are currently authored; I'm just giving basic ideas for now :) then the few authors interested in converting old table layouts into working table layouts could use the tool like that likewise it could check over <applet> and any other things HTML5 considers beneath itself ;) for authors, the idea would be to make working tables of either type conforming; broken tables of either type non-conforming 42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9: I think one thing you need to factor into this is that the JAWS thing was practical because it worked for a general case; but you can switch between interpreting a given table as layout or data. That may be a more important facility for dealing with tables then the algorithm for guessing layout vs data. that switch could be retained but the heuristics improved in HTML5 so you wouldn't need to use the switch so much Well, yes, but making users use a switch isn't ideal; and making layout tables non-conforming supports their conversion to something that doesn't require a switch. ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee, these are useful points :) but as you said, ""few authors interested in converting old table layouts"" mean big changes aren't going to happen in the legacy if the layout table description is good enough, you won't need to use the switch because the detection will be right most or all of the time indeed. which is why I don't think authorial conformance requirements should be designed around people tweaking legacy markup. if. yes. guess you (or someone) needs to go give their best shot at an algorithm yeah, I'm working on sponsorship to cover work like this but that still seems more about how UAs handle existing content than author conformance requirements (e.g. if you wanted to make it really easy for authors to indicate tables are for layout one could just have a layout attribute on table.) rather than requiring them to root through their th's the idea is only a tiny number of layout tables would need changes it will take research to figure out if legacy layout tables follow patterns consistently enough for this to be feasible :P I should imagine layout-table-forms vs. spreadsheet-table-forms would be a particularly painful area to try and spec out. that's something I've been discussing on Accessify Forum recently (as Cerbera): http://www.accessifyforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=9791 the UA part is at the end, summarised here: http://projectcerbera.com/blog/2008/04#day14 would be cool if we can find a sane way for these things to Just Work natively yes. 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46, hi 42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9: hi 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46, we've been talking about data tables, layout tables and tabular forms: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20080414#l-346 42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9: thanks, reading 42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9: many layout tables use <th> 42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9: and there are legitimate data tables with no <th> 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46, I'm not sure how many is many. <th> seems rare any place I've looked... 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46, a table with no headers is using layout to indicate relationships rather than labelling...so I'm not sure if that's a ""legitimate"" data table.

non-predator,b6b2651088d2e8165f3e8255b2854bd8,"so i wonder how to define sandboxes such that if you have document A with iframe containing document B with iframe containing document C that: 1. if A, B, and C are from the same origin, B can't play with C hm wait i was going to say that if B and C have hte same origin but aren't the same as A they should be able to talk but no, that would still allow problems so we really do want unique origins... hmm that makes it easier HMM. ponders so I assume you are thinking sandboxes that still have script enabled? (since for noscript iframes this would not matter) maybe I should step back and ask what use cases you are targetting actually same-origin matters even without scripts a bunch of things use the origin concept but yes, i am considering scripts too like frame targetting? yeah, that sometimes uses origin I think the desired restrictions depend on the use cases ones I can imagine: - blog comments - user-authored content in a profile on a social network site - ""widgets"" embedded from off-site - ""widgets"" hosted by the provider of the page containing them - ads comments and other user-contributed content, gadgets (same site and other site; including ads), and (not sandboxing but still <iframe> related) client-side includes are the main ones ads are complicated because at least some ad networks consider it important to support frameless flash ads that overlay the content but anything that can overlay the content is not properly sandboxed by definition there are indeed various scenarios with varying levels of sandboxing http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/sandbox has my current strawman proposal (cut and pasted from the start of the e-mail i'm writing; note that i've used past tense because it'll be past tense once i send the mail, but the spec isn't actually updated yet) for comments you would like them to be able to size naturally and seem to be inline as far as the end-user is concerned, but they should not be able to css position outside their area yeah the comments would be <iframe sandbox=""unrestricted-origin"" seamless src=""data:text/html,(small html document)""></iframe> I'm thinking about whether inheriting styles and applying outer stylesheets may be a security risk in certain cases it is in others not so much i can't see how it could be in a script-limited blog comment case I'm thinking for the comment use case and the user-generated content on hosted profile page use case oh i have to disble forms too while i'm at it and also plugins probably yeah (including Java) updated sandbox file I am nervous about the performance impact of using an iframe per comment with hundreds of comments yeah me too i'm not sure what else to do though navigating the parent should be restricted (dunno if that falls out of other things), including back/forward window sizing and positioning should be restricted any browsing context navigation outside the sandbox is blocked does embedding further subframes in the content need to be restricted? though that does mean that links in comments won't work or do they just inherit the sandbox restrictions already in effect? i don't see why it should be, but they certainly are also sandboxed and they're not in the same sandbox, either links in blog comments not working is kind of a bummer perhaps there should be a way to turn that on, since it can't be used as an annoyance in the noscript case yeah comments would now be <iframe sandbox=""unrestricted-origin force-links-to-parent"" seamless src=""data:text/html,(small html document)""></iframe> it's getting long the keywords are a bit verbose it's a security thing, i'm worried about making them too simple i'm especially worried about making them sound like they _increase_ security when all the keywords decrease it somewhow perhaps there should be two addtributes sandbox="""" or restrict="""" that turns everything off, and an allow="""" attribute to turn things back on selectively or sandbox-exceptions="""" well ""force-links-to-parent"" isn't really an exception or a restriction, it just changes the rules to send all user-activated links to the parent browsing context you could achieve that with <base target=""parent""> and allowing targetted links to parent only a bit more work but makes it strictly an exception, not a behavior change (<iframe seamless sandbox allow=""..."" src=""data:text/html,(small html document)""></iframe> makes sense, but i'm not sure what the keywords would be) though if it is not a restriction or an exception perhaps it should be a separate attribute like seamless well the idea is that you can allow whatever random content in the sandbox as you want so i'm not sure i want to be poking <base> into it ooo wait! it can just be part of seamless' behaviour! for the comment use case presumably the data: URL is generated by software and the user's comment does not have <html> or <body>? oh interesting comments would now be <iframe sandbox=""unrestricted-origin"" seamless src=""data:text/html,(small html document)""></iframe> again is it ever useful to allow gadgets to navigate the parent or open a window? probably, but i want to start with as small a set of allowed behaviours as possible I guess for gadgets, anything forbidden can be selectively exposed via postMessage eah y maybe seamless should base its origin determination on the ""real"" origin, not the origin affected by sandbox="""" 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: i think the seamless navigation rule should only apply to navigations triggered by the content of the iframe as opposed to what? 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: if the parent doc navigates a seamless iframe it should not navigate itself hm, that makes things more complex why would you use target="""" on a seamless iframe? why not just change .data? or .src or whatever changing .src is a navigation not per spec oh actually it is nevermind i'm thinking of <object> well put it this way, changing iframe.src, changing iframe.contentWindow.location, and targetted link aimed at iframe all go at the same code path at least in WebKit yeah spec too ok well i could just do it for <a> links knowing the source frame of a navigation is not a big deal i guess we always have to know anyway though what do you call the source if someone from another iframe clicks a link using .click() ? or what if frame A calls .click() on a link in frame B which has a target="""" to A, which is seamless? I would say only cases where the source frame is the seamless frame itself should get retargetted sure but what is the source frame in that example? I don't know in general what a cross-frame click() call on a link considers the source frame presumably something has to define which it is in any case I don't think it matters which is chosen from security POV since A has to have unrestricted origin in your scenario and thus could just modify B to do something bad well i've never had to define it before now :-) but i agree it doesn't really matter much so long as it is defined i guess i'll just add an ""argument"" to the ""navigate"" algorithm and make all the call sites say what the source is defines the term ""source browsing context"" (better terms welcome) hm, this causes <meta http-equiv=refresh> inside a seamless iframe to navigate the parent iframe oh hey, we do need this, to define .referer better :-)"

I must say that I am a litle bit disapointed. in what? the GE or de documentation? The documentation. It's not that it's bad. To be honest it's very good for beginers. I just wanted some more. too bad i don't like it when that happens Greetings everybody! _o/ About the Python GameLogic API. In the main site it's still for 2.34. Is it the same with the current version? quick question... how to I import a 2D-shape (e.g. SVG) in blender for extrusion? Is that the only format you can save as, MacSlow? Looks like >= 2.40 supoprts importing SVG. Helixgruven, well that's the most obvious format I can think of atm Here's a script for importing it as a path: <a href=""http://jmsoler.free.fr/didacticiel/blender/tutor/cpl_import_svg_en.htm"">http://jmsoler.free.fr/didacticiel/blender/tutor/cpl_import_svg_en.htm</a> it's not like I've AI here (on Linux) Yeah, I run AI in VMware. But... there's InkScape too. that's what I was thinking of That's pretty sweet, that script. Handy for 3d-ifying logos. I've lots of stuff in EPS with beziers. I'll have to test it out today =) hm... I've copied the svg2obj_050.py in my ~/.blender/scripts and restarted blender... but not sure where I can trigger it now for importing a plain svg ah... found it File -> Import? If you switch to the scripts window and click Scripts -> Update Menus, I don't think you have to restart. hm... I cannot get the extrusion to go into the depth... blender extrudes the imported .svg in the plane of the svg itself I wonder how I can set a normal to instruct blender in which direction I want the .svg to extrude. Try hitting e, then x, y, or z. One of the latter three being the plane you wish to extrude in. Helixgruven, extrude is only available in edit-mode and there I cannot set any ""extrusion direction"" via x-,y- or z-keys How did the shape import, is it a bezier path? does anyone know how to add a bezier-curve as a ipo-curve in python? (object should follow the path) Why would you use python for that? because i import the scene from xml ah well that should be interesting What you probably want to do is just create the physical curve object in blender, and do the magic of parenting your object to it and making it follow that path rather than trying to create an IPO out of it That way you can then change it hm, the problem is, the program should execute from the console and call blender in background-mode isn't it possible to just define the handlers of the bezier-curve? well you'd setup the knot vectors and such See the Curve module of the Blender Python API yes, that's what i'm trying to do hm... BezTriple.vec -> a list of the 3 points [ handle, knot, handle ] that comprise a BezTriple, with each point composed of a list [x,y,z] of floats. The list looks like [ [H1x, H1y, H1z], [Px, Py, Pz], [H2x, H2y, H2z] ]. There you is all done :) hmm how do i get the coords of the knot? i would better if one could define just the distance of the knot from the handle otherwise i have to calculate the points The knot I think is a point, but the handles are *vectors* aren't they? i don't know... it say [x][y][z] for every point... <- this a point no vector right? but then it has to be 2 beztriples to form a bezcurve Hello :) yippieh blenderartists.org gives me an answer ;) bt = BezTriple.New((1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9,0)) j yes how do you like the idea of having a place where people can release their openSource blender projects/scenes/models/... ? Or even use a verse server to collaborate on projects? Project collaboration I agree with I'm not terribly sure I want everyone and their brother meddling with my creative work. You'd have to have splits every time someone modified something, else they make a modification and it goes through a moderation process. Seems like too much tape for me. not to mention all the goofy people that would steal the work and sell it on turbo squid [Relic]: hear hear I like for my work to remain MINE :) I was playing with those bezier import scripts for AI, SVG, and EPS, but they don't play nice with compund paths. Have any of you had any experience with using the DXF exporter in Illustrator to get shapes into blender? The idea is to be able to take a vector graphic and bring it into blender instead of tracing a bitmap. yeah i created a bezier-curve in python =) now i need to find out, how to make an move-ipo out of it maybe with xIpo.append(1,icu[1]) the same with y and zIpo Hi In this Tutorial <a href=""http://www.trcoding.de/informatik/blender/tasse/becherboden/becherboden.html"">http://www.trcoding.de/informatik/blender/tasse/becherboden/becherboden.html</a> the button REgion dos net exist after pressing E (xtrude) .. what do i need to do ? if you're in face select mode it'll extrude the region automatically if you're in vertex or edge select mode it'll ask you the mode is the thing whichi can change by pressing Tab ? no in edit mode, press ctrl+tab in ""vertices"" you can select vertices, in edges edges, and in faces faces ;P sounds logicall :D but nothing happens by pressing ctrl+tab make sure you're in edit mode edit mode= the mode in which i atm can select points+lines yup thats the mode i am in.. where can i see in which select mode i am ? and ctrl+tab does nothing? :/ if you're in vertex select mode, the vertices have (by default) purple dots on them if you're in face select mode, the middle of the faces have black dots ah i got the GUI-buttons when you're in face select, the extrude command won't ask what you want to extrude in edge select neither k well crtl+tab does not work, but nowi can handle this Tank you :) arg *thank hi all, I used the game engine for a walktrough at work (linux) and now I'm using the same official template on my mac, and the mouse wont move camera, while the arrows do move the actor.

Daveman: yo it's about time :D busy day :P heh stickmanonline, wrapbkgd.png when i use the DOM inspector, it does show me that wrap ENDS very prematurely... but I cannot determine why. Valid code, IE sees it, et cetera. (wrapbkgd is two thin white lines, vertical) after footnav try this <div style=""clear:both;"">&nbsp;</div> but before foot? and you might have to set html height to 100% no, after all the foot stuff ok ok before the closing tag for teh wrap div brb thank you! the clear both did not work but setting html to 100% height did now, why is that? :) in gecko broswers the html and body are note automatically set to 100% like IE theoretically, since the body background goes 100%, for example, i dont understand why html has to explictly be set hmmm but if the body was working.... something i just have to accept? =]] think of both body and html as divs in gecko browsers, their height is defined by the content or by the css sheet Right. Now, if the body has a background... and that body background goes 100%, why does not the html go 100% as dictated by its content (body)? stickmanonline, whoa! now look at how ugly! there's a boatload of space added to the end of the page LarryOtt: The background isn't on the body. There's a special case in CSS that only applies to HTML (not XML, XHTML parsed as XML, etc.): If a background is set on the body and not on the html element, the background actually gets applied to the html element instead of the body aha. thanks, nanobot. that helps me understand... special case. That's one of the common errors when people try to use XHTML sent as text/html. Get it parsed as XML (which most browsers usually don't do in that case) and suddenly the background is screwy The special case was made to account for the fact that the body is usually given a *margin* when, in terms of the background, it sort of acts like padding. Now, strangely to me, when I inspect the body (which is set to 100%) the DOM node blinks and is demonstrably shorter than its actual content. Very confusing, when I'm trying to figure out where all this extra space at the bottom came from. Can you link to the page? Nano, yes the XHTML as text/html issue has confused me before although people swear up and down it's not hard to understand. I just end up feeling stupid and get on with making things. Nanobot -> <a href=""http://ems.parkerhayden.net/"">http://ems.parkerhayden.net/</a> ;beware of xhtml @ LarryOtt LarryOtt: <a href=""http://www.webdevout.net/articles/beware_of_xhtml.php"">http://www.webdevout.net/articles/beware_of_xhtml.php</a> That article explains the problems with using XHTML today I'll read through that.. I was just skimming and see that hixie.ch link at the bottom which I've read a few times (without comprehending fully). My article has examples :) LarryOtt check to make sure you dont have any margins etc on the wrap either :) wow, I didn't know I should be putting &amp; into URLs stickmanonline, youa re correct. I have margin auto. I suppose that needs to be eliminated. I vaguely understand it might be ""auto"" adding space. But still don't know why. I'll try eliminating it. that should be fine, just no bottom margins :) margin: 0 auto 0 auto oops, yeah, I just removed my lff/rt margins heh Okay, problem still exists. LarryOtt: On #foot, you have height:100% That's 100% of the viewport height. That's causing the stretch BINGO! Oh, wow. That's not a concept I understood. Learning all kinds of stuff today =\ Of course, I had intended for 'foot' to take 100% of the remaining available space... for pages shorter than the screen...er, viewport. So, that's bad logic and the cause of this particular problem. Harumph! Thank you very much stickmanonline and Nanobot ...I'll continue reading this article. can anyone recommend a small and simple tooltip script? <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=small"">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=small</a>+and+simple+tooltip+script&btnG=Google+Search RTFS: join #cgi I take it there's no way to center something that's a float =] I stand corrected! <a href=""http://www.cssplay.co.uk/menus/centered.html"">http://www.cssplay.co.uk/menus/centered.html</a> Kinda ugly, though."

But there is no <head>... then use whatever metedata profile linking mechanism is present Well I'm somewhat of a noob, and confused as to the purpose of that link in the head what should I look for in the SVG spec to find something equivalent? perhaps metadata profile baseProfile = profile-name? Describes the minimum SVG language profile that the author believes is necessary to correctly render the content. The attribute does not specify any processing restrictions; It can be considered metadata. For example, the value of the attribute could be used by an authoring tool to warn the user when they are modifying the document beyond the scope of the specified baseProfile. Each SVG profile should define the ... ... text that is appropriate for this attribute. If the attribute is not specified, the effect is as if a value of ""none"" were specified."

I thought it was legit if peers asked other people tbsaunde: that's fuzzy to me, but possibly true davidb: well, surkov certainly asks other people :) does he r+ first? I think it depends, but certainly not on patches he write heh I'd be okay with transplanted trust. The module owners have final say on that. yeah I didn't want to interrupt you and askalski here. tbsaunde, so what do you think, can I keep it as a separate class? I can nest it in TextUpdater but I guess keeping it in separate file may have some point askalski: do what you think is reasonable :) ok, you'll see the patch proposition, and we'll talk again then tbh if I was designing this I probably wouldn't hve made textupdator a class in the first place, but shrug tbsaunde, I wonder one thing tbsaunde, there is ""skip prefix"" argument usually, when I hack something for myself just submitted a patch for a crasher.

Interesting. the problem is that if a site allows SVG image uploads, and has an open redirector, the images can ""phone home"" in unexpected ways Yeah, I understand the issue. You want to have a defined and limited contract for what ""images"" can do. we have an implicit one now hmm, maybe we can fix this another way can't we just remove SVG images? they're so wrong What? No! SVG images are great. I use 'em, and love 'em. for what? introducing security vulnerabilities? :) For scalable vector graphics! I let you fix the security vulnerabilities. why not just use SVG in HTML? i've used svg images before too bu t they having all these strange problems Can I easily reuse a single image in multiple places on the page with SVG-in-HTML? doesn't know enough. 1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb: with XBL! hides >_< <use>? Anyway, if you can do that, then SVG-in-HTML is fine. If not, then you still want SVG-in-<img>, or a similar solution. cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0: Does that work? i'm not sure how use interacts with being in HTML 1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb: i haven't tried to touch it with a stick, so dunno has just heard other people curse over <use> All these attributes on <use> confuse and enrage me. Oh, wait, I was looking at a decade-old WD. Dammit. It looks like you could maybe use <svg><symbol/></svg> in the head, and then <svg><use/></svg> in the document? Theoretically, at least. you can't put <svg> in head Why not? I guess you want it to break out implicitly. it implies <body> In text/html, anyway. Okay, well, <symbol> isn't supposed to ever be rendered, so it should be fine in <body> too. Hmm. Do document referenes in inline <svg> work across <svg> elements? mpilgrim: btw, opera 11 has nicer error messages for form validation, in case you have nothing better to do and feel like updating images in http://diveintohtml5.org/forms.html#validation :) SVG images are nice but some implementations are rather buggy .... cough cough 1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb: the feed would be more useful if the entries contained the diffs subscribes to the commits mailing list instead cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0: They don't? That's a pretty useless feed, then. I'll complain. <description>Message posted by Tab Atkins Jr.. via cvs-syncmail</description> is all Yeah, useless. I see that 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21 is discovering that it's hard to make arguments about complexity in the face of use-cases and an implementation w.r.t. SVG images or CSP? well, both 1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb: ideal would be log message as title and full diff as description i know we can't get rid of SVG images :) I learned that lesson in other places too cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0: Agreed. Audio WG for example its just a funny artifact of how svg came to the world 042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427, a feature can be too complex for *authors* even if you have use-cases and an implementation. Particularly security-related features. I totally agree it's just a hard argument to make when authors are saying ""no, I really want this"" 1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb: well, and which spec being updated in title, too not all authors, just some set of really smart authors --- the sort who tend to get involved in spec discussions, or work for Google and who think that being able to implement a professional audio mixing desk on a mobile device as a Web app is a completely reasonable requirement for the first version of a spec, cough cough 042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427, is there any point in joining that Audio WG? I imagine I'd mostly be saying ""no"" :) I dunno your feedback would actually be useful are you trying to reconcile your super-simple API with Google's filter graph? no, I don't think anyone's trying to do that phew so inventing a 3rd API then I guess? I don't know what to do I think I'll join after my vacation and see if there's anything fun happening we could add support for using Workers to generate audio. that would help with latency issues but fundamentally, if you have a hard requirement for minimal latency plus maximum possible throughput using the GPU to process samples etc, then sure OK you need to bake every effect under the sun into the browser is there any kind of idea about the model yet? push from script using something like writeSamples, or pull from script via a callback? Corban Brook was working on a JavaScript bridge implementing the google api on top of the mozilla api:https://github.com/corbanbrook/audionode.js I don't think the sample graph guys really care about JS that much in their world, if you have to process samples with JS you've already lost how low latency is low enough for them? what's the use case? I'm thinking the number 1 use case, all categories, is a NES emulator audio mixing desk if you can do that, nothing else matters :) instrument synthesis real-time spatial effects for games etc we can do the NES emulator, that's a non-issue :-) is there no minimum latency caused by the number of samples you have to write at a time or some such? I don't know you kinda have to be a super audio guru to participate in that WG and I don't have time to become one of course, if you have a small enough buffer then having to wait for the JS engine is eventually going to fall apart it's just a question of how small is small enough... so will C of course, JS will never be quite as efficient as C don't you have audio cards that you can upload sounds to and program the filters and whatnot in advance? which is why all features everywhere must be baked into the browser that's another issue yeah I really don't know, to me an audio card is just a D/A-converter plus the use of the GPU or another specialized processor processing audio isn't that expensive... it is if you want to mix 300 channels with spatial effects and more sure, not all Web developers want to do that but the Audio WG people do :-) what kind of system is that possible in? and they want to do it on browsers embedded on mobile devices don't you need really expensive hardware? or can their filter graph thingy work on anything? I don't know ok, so I'll join the WG and ramble a bit in 2 weeks please stop them from doing crazy stuff in the meantime :) I'm not optimistic the point I was making w.r.t. Adam was that if someone wants a feature, and someone else is providing it, it's really hard to get in the middle and tell them they shouldn't do that on the grounds of complexity, at least uh, so who's providing? Chrome? Chrome and Safari the code is in Webkit ""The ones that win are the ones that ship."" sucky but true mozilla guys are providing too though - in that they've landed and documented an api e2633ed61085592add6e058692dfff2f, they? is it not you? cdd23ac03f92596256b5ebc603df251b: no, it wasn't the auckland office that worked on it oh, ok if it was I'd be pushing hard for it in the working group. As it is I'm not sure what the best approach is. me neither, but the filter graph API *looks* way too complicated yes maybe the right solution is WebAL or something there's also been discussion on MusicML and supporting other music bsaed things which could become a distraction surely browsers shouldn't support MusicML natively? I'm not opposed to a WebGL like approach where we wrap OpenSL/OpenAL or something like that and let people build JS API's on top e2633ed61085592add6e058692dfff2f, appart from the fact that I've never even looked at OpenSL or OpenAL, I'm inclined to agree I should sleep :)"

Ancient1, use gnome panel in KDE? :p benJIman: morning :) I did SuseUX: yes ykphuah: YOU updates only have security updates normally ykphuah: suse generally backport security fixes to the version shipped with the distro the only reason usually new versions of mozilla stuff are shipped instead is that they make doing that very difficult, as they mix the fixes, and don't inform distributors of changes then why has ubuntu got 1.5.0.5 as a security update so quick? there is much QA testing updates have to pass for a start"

non-predator,e8cda38ef5830f1a828a14c011f83bc4,"i wonder why opera's reload scrolling behavior is so much better than firefox and chrome's maybe they're waiting until onload or something to scroll and opera does it as soon as possible the problem is that reloading may load images too, which requires several reflows which may change the position of the anchor ff and chrome's behavior is just really bad and annoying and opera's works well i always reload in firefox, it leaves me at the top, I start scrolling down the page, then seconds later it suddenly scrolls to the old position Are there tests for the HTML5 serializer anywhere? just found a bug in both Gecko and WebKit HTML5 serialization annevk, is there any way using CSSOM View or something to tell whether a <br> is collapsed or is actually creating a line break? I.e., whether it could be removed without affecting layout? You could actually remove it, I guess . . . that might work. I'm toying around with the history API I need to set a stateObj for the initially loading page so I can get back to that state trough the popstate event but that where the trouble starts I have the following inside a domready event: history.replaceState({""page"": page}, null, window.location); history.state = {""page"": page}; but that doesn't work (just one of those doesn't either) it does work fine if I reload the page once am I missing something or could this be a browser bug? I tested with Safari 5.1beta and Firefox 4 Hmm, actually removing it works for me, I guess. <br>'s behavior doesn't seem very well-defined at all . . . Oh, of course -- it messes up ranges. tries display: none instead I'm not sure how much detail to go into in copying over code for the examples at http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Dialogs - does anyone know will the entire javascript function be needed or just those lines relevant to showing the dialog? I'm new to this so I don't know how much real world example detail is needed :) 7582b9974a1186715aba1d2adc5eca44, I dunno, I guess enough for people to figure out how it works and what it does. A description might be more useful than copying the code, especially if you can link to the code. Hmm, yeah. It's minified code which doesn't help, but I guess I can say ""It displays this element"" or somesuch minified code is a crime imo. we already have compression at the protocol level The only thing it seems to be good at is making it harder for other people to read :( It's situations like this I'm thankful for webkit inspector's pretty print :) pretty print can only do so much when variable names get substituted too Yeah. Luckily, this code is pretty simple so it's easy to work out what the variables do, but you're right, I've never used minified code unless it's something like jquery - never seen the point can anyone tell me why this bloats up memory in firefox and opera? http://daten.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/src/wer-kuesst-wen/ webkit seems to have no problems. 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: What bug did you find in serialization? i think it may be a problem because i load these images repeatedly. b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, <pre>\nfoo</pre> serializes to <pre>\nfoo</pre> which parses to <pre>foo</pre>. but then that would be a serious caching bug, wouldn't it? HTML says to add a linebreak after a <pre> start tag always. It would probably make more sense to only add one if the first character is a linebreak. lots of small images shouldn't bloat memory. 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: OK, it is the bug I knew about then :) But anyway it's a browser bug, even if there's also a spec bug. Also, Gecko serializes <xmp> wrong, it escapes < and & and such. 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: We try to do that right but I am a bit scared it will have some compat impact (with Ragnarok) 7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6: havn't looked at that, but oddly, it's WebKit i've always found is really really bad at loading small images (or any images) repeatedly 06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6, i am working to fix the issue that the images are loaded repeatedly every frame, but over time, it will still bloat. Could someone explain why this is 0? http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/1032 scratches his head It doesn't make sense to me. The span creates a box, why should the box have zero height? Hmm, does clientHeight only work on blocks, maybe? Oh, right. ""The clientTop, clientLeft, clientWidth, and clientHeight attributes must return zero if the element does not have any associated CSS layout box or if the CSS layout box is inline."" I think I want offsetHeight. Why the difference, I don't know . . . he, still not as bad as inadvertedly triggering a memory leak. 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: All those APIs are weird I think Apparently. I meaniirc they are a hotch-potch of things that different browsers invented Whihc doesn't typically lead to great quallity I still would like some input on my idea though about a method for <track> to programatically add cues (add/remove/edit)"

I hope there is no quorum in this group : it is a nearly public wg, there may be many inactive ""invited expert"" in the future I'm sure there will be a few rounds of house cleaning. At least to change membership from ""Good"" to ""Not Good"" standing. I don't think we should require quorum especially since we'll give at least a week to give input on decisions http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/policies.html#def-Consensus Consensus: A substantial number of individuals in the set support the decision and nobody in the set registers a Formal Objection. Individuals in the set may abstain. Abstention is either an explicit expression of no opinion or silence by an individual in the set. Unanimity is the particular case of consensus where all individuals in the set support the decision (i.e., no individual in the set abstains). By default, the set of individuals eligible to participate in a decision is the set of group participants in Good Standing. The Process Document does not require a quorum for decisions (i.e., the minimal number of eligible participants required to be present before the Chair can call a question). A charter MAY include a quorum requirement for consensus decisions. *may* Well, there we go. :-) thank you for the precision f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb: thanks.

You mean how many of the actual tree formats? yeah minidom, etree Dunno about BeautifulSoup simpletree can obviously be changed What are you planning? SVG support and MathML while I'm at it through a shared phase if possible I was thinking of doing that on a branch that's ok oh, you're planning it too? Well I don't have much time so I don't mind having fewer plans :) my idea was to keep everything case-insensitive and handle everything in the phase and correct case for the few elements that need it upon node creation e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: That won't work with SVG as specced though, right? thinks case sensitivity is easy to add Oh, I see yeah, but I'm not sure why case sensitivity is useful for authors That seems to require a lot of language-specific knowledge in the parser a lot? Well you need to know which elements are case sensitive in each language. no, you just need to know that if you find textarea in the SVG context it needs to be inserted as textArea Is that the only example in SVG+MathML? MathML is like HTML, everything lowercase SVG has a few elements and attributes with mixed case you'd just put those in a frozenset and handle it all when creating an element and adding attributes Yeah, I see it could work. I don't know what the right thing to do is though. I think consistency within text/html has some value, but yeah Are you planning to cater for mathml inside html inside SVG inside... well, you go out of <svg> when you hit <foreignObject> <foreignObject> -> in body phase so yes, that would work MathML has <semantics> to cater for that I believe, but MathML may allow other ways of nesting as well somehow, I'm amused by an element named <semantics> b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, so the main thing I guess is treebuilder support and testsuite support and then figuring out if SVG and MathML can share a phase or if different phases would be more appropriate hopes for a shared phase testsuite support isn't obviously tricky; the main requirement is that we don't have to rewriet our existing tests b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: is that a real proposal? so modifying the dump format to allow elements in other namespaces with a prefix 139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884, it's a MathML element we were discussing MathML really has an element called that? yeah it's like SVG <foreignObject>: http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/chapter2.html#id.2.1.4 it's overloaded and very unspecific on how you handle it b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, a prefix could work I suppose, although it might confuse people... Why would they be confused? <svg> http://www.w3.org/2000/svg <svg:svg> ? svg:svg because the tagname is actually ""svg"" in the DOM and not ""svg:svg"" but I guess it's ok hmm. I guess I could improve UI if the front end said SVG element foo instead of element foo from namespace http://www.w3.org/2000/svg actually, I prefer something like ""| <svg> svg"" to make that more clear actually that's a good point, <svg>svg is better over svg:svg you type faster than me :) we also need to add support for namespaced attributes href needs to mapped to xlink:href with xlink bound to the XLink namespace I'm afraid this is all for today though, I've to go in half an hour has to do other stuff this afternoon as well b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, maybe we should do this as part of the HTML WG meeting if there's some time b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, some hacking might be a nice distraction Sounds good"

Before you apply a greyscale image as a displacement map you have to subdivide it first? davidleon, isn't it ;) yes Shaba1 first or after, but you need before you render LOD: if the case is much complicated what can i do? i mean totally different two object OK the tute in the release notes never actually say that no problem, you only need to keep the same number of Vertex in all meshes for doing what ?

(asking the router) to stop working?= to not look up try to reach a website that you havent load before look how long that takes whatever.com or so just did one I hadn't used before. really quick ah ok can i have a look at your /etc/resolv.conf? sure # cat /etc/resolv.conf nameserver 192.168.1.254 ah yes that should be your router yeah it is. everything else is fine now with only changing ip to fixed one instead of using dhcp? well, it seems fine now. however I should give it a bit more time. i sitll get the DHT firewalled crap, and azureus barely works.. but at least it hasn't killed the rest of my connection yet i just set my router as dns again and restarted network services, now trying to surf internet afk 5 mins k re needed to restart azureus too. surfingspeed is fine again, lookups very fast now waiting for faster downrate in azureus then testing surfing again hola xris_ everything is working fine now, now i just need to find out how to use two different network settings depending on which cable i have in my networkplug... at home or somewhere else i need fixed ip in the case of being at home... and dhcp in the case of being somewhere else hmm... not sure how to do that?! i will find a solution somehow"

Or could you tuck away multiple data properties in one itemid ? You can use itemprop to specify more properties (You may or may not want to put the ISBN in an itemprop instead of using itemid, I guess) Myeah, but that would put the data in the html as content again, no? You can do <meta itemprop=""isbn"" content=""whatever""> for hidden metadata Oh, now that is cool. I thought <meta> elements could only be used within the <head> of a page. http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/semantics.html#the-meta-element has special rules for where <meta itemprop> is permitted Thanks for the info!! Very useful indeed :) (The problem with data-imdbid if you don't control both content and script is that you have way to know that other people's content is using data-imdbid in the way you expect, instead of using it for something totally different, whereas microdata (or RDFa etc) uses the itemtype URL to disambiguate) Yeah, it's starting to dawn on me :) I wonder if microdata will ever become a real standard though.

It's okay for front-end devvers, but I still need to explain to back-end devvers why <p class=""title""> is no good :p What does ""real standard"" mean? :-) 40eda15e7dc79a3db84ccb838f5e7ab4: You can teach them through monoelement xml ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: something that will actually be used and recognized as a working standard. It's so much easier to just use a data- attribute and ignore the spec. Hoping it will turn into a ""paving the cowpath"" situation. If you want to ignore the spec there's no need to even use data-, just use <div imdbid=""...""> or whatever Yeah, but I'll never do that because it won't validate. It's like using the <address> element for an actual element. It's not permitted, but at least the validator won't complain :D What's wrong with <div class=""imdbid:x"">? :( It has a colon in it >:-( I guess this is why we should be using xhtml You can practically taste the awkward silence following that remark :p But thanks for the info, at least now I know why you guys made the difference between internal/external scripts It's okay, nobody here listens to me anyway :) 40eda15e7dc79a3db84ccb838f5e7ab4: You could just stick with the class attribute in a microformat-ish way, but then you have to define how to extract the metadata from an HTML page, which is complex if you have non-trivial data structures - the purpose of microdata is to define a single way of extracting generic structured data from HTML so you don't have to worry about that problem yourself (Your code doesn't have to care about <meta> or <link> or itemscope or itemprop or anything, it just uses a microdata parser library which returns a simple JSON-ish structure or whatever, or at least it would if such libraries existed yet)"

And HTML5 is how much longer, twenty times as long? :/ is ballparking last estimate was 50000 tests needed maybe that was optimistic HTML5 has lots of features, many different facets to test for each, very detailed requirements for most of them, and some nontrivial interactions among different features so probably the level of test coverage needed is even higher than comparison of length to CSS would imply though to be fair, CSS is also pretty damn complicated CSS is prolly more complicated most of HTML5 is written in a pretty straightforward way CSS has very complex interactions You couldn't test a lot of HTML5 requirements in a cross-browser way, could you? You'd need something more like Mozilla's mochitests, that can synthesize input and whatnot. CSS has some very complex interactions by design HTML5 has a fair number of complex interactions by accident of history there are many HTML requirements that would be hard to test if the browser itself is your only test tool that doesn't mean you can't do it in a cross-browser way How would you do it, then? Except manually, of course. doesn't want to see anyone try running 100,000 tests manually :P one possible way is to run an external program to synthesize input events, and possibly capture output people have made such tools that work with any given browser, for example for testing Web sites or for general QA of any native application with a GUI i generated about 15000 tests for a css feature ""Generated""? of course for any conformance requirement that can be tested by scripting against the DOM, that's the best way to do it yeah, i wrote some python scripts although i wanted to generate more for interaction with svg So how many substantively different things did these 15,000 tests actually test? i tested different combinations of percentages, lengths and keywords, visibility:hidden/visible, and the different values for the feature, for a number of different elements including invalid cases oh and with different images"

It's not a bad place I think the spec about it is not clear and some browser are imlpementing in a way and some in another way and I think one of the way is useful in real-world uses and the other is useless and the useless way could be emulated while the opposite needs no crossbrowser unusual tricks The spec is precise about what it intends (though that's not the same as ""clear"") - effectively the whole canvas should be cleared and then the new shape drawn on top, since that's how the drawing model works the fact is I'm trying to draw curves with different opacities inside it - to draw with tablet pressure but each curve is one opacity so I'm trying to emulate it with ""copy"" but if copy is not what I hope it is there is not a good way to get tablet pressure in canvas Can you get it to clip to the shape you're wanting to fill, before drawing with 'copy', so that it won't affect pixels outside that shape? ""destination-out"" + ""copy""? I mean like 'drawYourPathOutline(); ctx.save(); ctx.clip(); ctx.globalCompositeOperation = ""copy""; ctx.fill(); ctx.restore();' thanks you Philip. I hope it could work the fact is I'm trying to have a blurred curve (using shadows) with tablet pressure maybe the clipping could create problems with the blur around each line could be possible to propose a spec about a line with different opacity, shadow and color and size for each ""node"" of the curve? and gradations of the nodes proprieties on the lines between the nodes ok.

(i mean an actual use case, not ""build a DOM"" or ""emulate this other API"") running scripts in weird places is one of the main causes of there being arcane parts to the platform 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: the annoying part is that people who've filed WebKit and Gecko bugs about this just say what behavior they want--not what their use case was yeah, i hear ya i'm battling the i18n wg as we speak over doing exactly that 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: the current plan is the run scripts from fragments created by XSLTPrecessor, so we'd still have to support fragments with executable scripts and of course manually built ones does anyone actually use xslt to generate scripts? that's just frightening who knows what Dark Matter does with XSLTProcessor instrument the code and find out 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: as for scripts created via <?xml-stylesheet?>, there's a Chrome Experement doing that which is why the issue is now on my plate feel free to break chrome experiments i'm happy to take the blame at google for that 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I believe that would be against our privacy principles to instrument code without a Test Pilot opt-in sure, i wasn't suggesting doing it without user consent i just meant in a special build or something don't you have betas specifically for this purpose? i mean, instrumented betas not necessarily the main beta line I'm not aware of Mozilla doing intrumented betas ah well get the chrome team to do it and even if we did, there'd be the problem of getting Dark Matter users to use them 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21 will likely be happy to set it up what's Dark Matter? I thought you just meant random people Out There. 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: enterprise intranets or extranets you're going to run scripts from fragments? that seems crazy :) yeah well if we're going to live in fear of breaking enterprise intranets, we'll just end up in analysis paralysis 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: is non-running in WebKit by design or by accident? 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: why would be go ahead and break stuff that used to work just for the sake of making scripts run less? s/be/we/ there are architectural problems with running scripts without a frame in webkit the JavaScript engine can do it 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: oh, I don't mean running scripts while they aren't in a DOM that's in a browsing contenxt but the code that knows how to talk to the JavaScript engine would be very confused *context b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: making scripts run less seems like a goal in and of itself to me. certainly in weird places like xslt where the security and interoperability implications are rather esoteric and not necessarily understood by many people. 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: I mean running scripts when a fragment is inserted into a DOM that's being displayed in a browsing context which reminds me that I was about to file a spec bug about not running scripts that are in a document but the document doesn't have a browsing context ah, that's technically feasible 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: the specific case we're talking about instrumenting is the output of XSLT transforms that contain scripts 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: see http:/ b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9.iki.fi/test/moz/scripts/ scripts = script tags ? or do inline event handlers count too? i think in gecko it creates an actual dom 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: script nodes 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: http:/ b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9.iki.fi/test/moz/scripts/createContextualFragment.html anyway, if xslt is defined in terms of just creating a dom or a serialisation that's then parsed, it seems that this all just falls out of the spec as is 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: http:/ b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9.iki.fi/test/moz/scripts/XSLTProcessor-transformToFragment.html how is xslt defined? (is it defined?) 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: those two run the script in Firefox 3.6 and in Opera 10.63 but not in WebKit i think all these code paths chase down the same path as innerHTML for inline scripts the parser is responsible for kicking off script execution 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: it's easy to see how you'd accidentally make createContextualFragment prevent execution by reusing innerHTML infrastructure but it doesn't do that if there's no frame 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: but http:/ b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9.iki.fi/test/moz/scripts/XSLTProcessor-transformToFragment.html is different to answer your question, i have no idea whether its intentional 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: ok i think XSLT was added because someone at IBM complained i'm not sure how many people actually care about it IE's behaviour on http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/dom/level0/timers/nph-010-demo.html is shocking to me does IE really wait until the document is entirely loaded before doing anything? surely i'm just doing something wrong 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: fwiw, I believe the closest thing to an XSLTProcessor spec is https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Using_the_Mozilla_JavaScript_interface_to_XSL_Transformations well transformToDocument should definitely not run the scripts but i guess if you want the ""already executed"" flag to not be set, so long as the execution only happens once the stuff is inserted into the real document and not the innerHTML document, i guess we could finagle that it'd be a bit of a hack... the reason the spec right now sets ""already executed"" the way it does, in addition to being ok for compat for innerHTML, is that the Document it's parsing into has no global scope so it can't run script anyway what's the benefit of running scripts? it's unclear to me that there is one 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: at least jQuery goes through trouble to make itself a fragment parser that does run scripts i'd much rather just not run them interesting JohnResig: do you have input for use cases for or against createContextualFragment creating executable scripts? i still think we should have some way of parsing a fragment that lets you whitelist tags and attributes its not really related, but its very popular in server-side frameworks though it's unclear if jQuery would benefit from the behavior that would result from createContextualFragment creating executable script nodes, because those scripts wouldn't execute in order when the fragment is inserted to the DOM :) it would be so nice if people filing these bugs said more about their higher-level use cases agreed I asked the reporters to elaborate on their use cases in both bugzillas whatwg.org is really really slow for me. just me?"

I have a question about firing media events the spec clearly says that some should fire synchronously, eg. ""must synchronously fire a progress event called loadstart"" (4.8.10.4) and others are clearly asynchronous, eg. ""must queue a task to fire a simple event called play"" (4.8.10.7) but the descriptions in the section on ready states (4.8.10.6) are somewhat ambiguous eg. ""and fire a simple event called play"" (even though ""canshowcurrentframe"" and ""play"" are explicitly asynchronous elsewhere) so are the ready state change events fired differently from others? ""fire a simple event"" is synchronous, but that doesn't preclude an error in the spec :-) i should probably remove th word ""synchronously"" from the spec so that it doesn 't confuse people when i omit it OK, thanks. wait, hold on it has to be asynchronous for those there's nothing to be synchronous with good, that's what I was about to argue. now I don't need to bother ;) i'll file a bug saying that these should be fixed to say that a task should be queued to fire the events that was quick. thanks!

Rely on or be completely independent from the IRI/URI specs; and define things declaratively or imperatively, being two main ones. 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: i think we're best off doing an independent imperative-style spec for this. you don't think we'll run into less trouble later if we output something that the URI spec can parse? 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: maybe with a (normative) appendix that defines the semantics in terms of an IRI 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: the uri spec doesn't define parsing oh, i thought there was a regular expression in the appendix that did the parsing 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: but assuming you mean something the uri spec thinks is valid, then no, because the whole problem is that there are invalid uris we need to handle that have no valid mapping. i see 816e4ece7c83a8a77ea9d52f8156a5ce: btw I‚Äôm not sure I understand your metaphor ‚Äî do you mean this usage (in which case what is the equivalent of headlines) or any use of mark? one annoying thing is that the parsing depends on whether the UA understands a given scheme 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: i basically see no value in defining things the way the spec used to have it, or the way [webaddresses] had it, where the implementor has to do some work to pass the string to some other function to do more work 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: i think we're better off just defining the parsing once and being done with it ok 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: (we can mostly defer to iri/uri for validity definitions, though) we're going to run into trouble later on, but we can deal with that then a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: btw, sorry not to catch up this week ‚Äî it became 3 days of meetings. also can you put a flowchart aside for Daniel? Also Kyle has a little something for you to read too there are two mostly independent algorithms: parsing cannonicalization 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: re the annoying thing, i think our best bet is to have hard-coded definitions of the special behaviour for the important schemes, and require generic handling of all the remaining schemes 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: there are three, i think - parsing, resolving, and canonicalisation/serialisation ok, that includes default ports and whether the scheme uses the authority-style oh, yeah resolving i haven't gotten to that one the ""authority-style"" thing is mostly gone in the more recent specs, iirc forms the URL-spec cheerleaders club to motivate our heroic editor and entertain the crowds well, foo:bar becomes foo://bar if foo is a ""standard URL scheme"" yeah iirc the new uri specs have something generic to say about that, i forget what exactly in GURL parlance anyway but yeah my point is i think we can draw a line in the sand and make it Just Work in the future for future schemes, at least for unknown ones and define what's known not sure what to do about ports we should check what the official specs say default ports can cannonicalized away since they claim to be knowledge-agnostic nowadays iirc for known schemes s/can/get/ 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: personally all i need is something to reference for the two red boxes in http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html#urls Also what‚Äôs the situation with no year-only @datetime? I guess it‚Äôs on purpose, but I wonder why given year-month and year-week pattern you need to understand default ports to do security origin comparisons correctly 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: ideally also we'd get a slightly less mathematical definition of ""absolute url"" 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: yeah, we might just be stuck with the knowledge thing 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: @datetime? 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: you mean <ins datetime="""">? 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: sorry, <time datetime=""""> 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: in webkit the security origin class has its own table of default ports that separate from the one in the URL library which is kind of goofy 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: yeah that's pretty special ok, i think i understand your requirements i'll probably start a github project and start writing something next week 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: the point of <time> is two-fold, (1) to make it easier to import times into a calendar, e.g. via microdata, and (2) make styling locale-specific 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: When I think about it, using <mark> isn't so bad in this context... really, there is no equivalent for headlines (via my metaphor). My apologize :) 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: neither of these makes much sense for years hixie: cool, thanks for explaining 816e4ece7c83a8a77ea9d52f8156a5ce: I thought it was a nice creative use too, but it seems I should just be using the <a> that‚Äôs there, and wrapping it in <mark> is stretching <mark>‚Äôs meaning a little far :) it‚Äôs fun to think about how new elements can be used though huh"

non-predator,ff11848d196dee50b4afedda6e2bfa25,"why i do believe Leif just asked me to shut up paranoia. I think Leif said that 80%-20% was a poor argument in a discussion. ""Save it up for later."" seems pretty clear to me yes :) but I do not read it the same way than you how do you read it? i'm curious as to what he meant i'm confused because he immediately sent another e-mail asking questions and i don't know if he wants me to reply or not probably safest not to I always try to take a step back for any comments on the mailing-list :/ because I would end up at leaving my job every day ;) So the way I read it is hmm. I read it as shut up too ""80% is an argument that you always use, I'm not convinced by it, save it for later."" it wasn't intended to be an argument ooops French argument = point of discussion and i don't understand how saving it for later would make it any more acceptable not dispute right, it wasn't intended to be a point of discussion -- it's just how languages have to be designed you always have to draw a line as to how much to include in your perspective it's not clear to me that there can be useful perspectives where you don't draw a line though i'd love to hear of one if there are some of course the line has to be drawn somewhere, it's just a matter of finding out wheere imagine a line based on the inclusion of diversity more than the democracy (democracy being the power of the majority as opposed to the Republics without entering too much into details) what do you mean by ""diversity""? we are drifting... but let's say. For example, the republics guarantee the rights of minority because the respect of this diversity is important for the design of a society. Democracies at the opposite impose the power of big numbers on minority usually a mix of the two is useful. ok... (looking for how this applies to language design) accessibility for example, or internationalisation. a feature can be useful for a limited number of persons, but without the feature, the language will not be useful in this precise context. Same for the inclusion of some rare characters in unicode. suddenly remembers how much usenet sucks when we could not type accents typing French. When some people started to mention that it would be cool to modify the implementation. Some people said it was folly. 67ab482559bf3f830bdf948ab892778a, I don't understand the point you are trying to make. I thought you were trying to explain a perspective where a line doesn't have to be drawn, but then you gave an example where it was drawn in a different place. f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: I just said there is not one unique line, I said it was a question of perspective, point of view. :) being binary doesn't help well sure, my point was just that you do have to draw a line which you seem to agree with, despite saying earlier that that was just ""in my perspective"" is now confused as to both karl's opinion _and_ leif's opinion! I understand Lief's opinion, he just objects to the 80%-20% argument because he sees it as a way to ignore the minority, particularly on accessibility ooo, yet another mailing list your line is 80/20 rationale. what I said being your perspective :) f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: ah, then he's probably misunderstanding it. i thought i was pretty careful about saying it was 80% of _tables_, not 80% of _users_. you decided to draw the line on this principle 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: yes, a lot of people do misunderstand it f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: because it is often used not only to categorize data, but to remove options to people. some don't realise that it's not a fixed ratio either, it needs to be evaluated on a case by case basis depending on numerous other factors what's the status of the design proposals? can i add one? principles, rather maybe, what are you thinking of adding? So I guess each time we categorize data like this, we have to propose something that will not exclude people falling into the 20%. people don't fall into percentages it's 80% of _content_, not 80% of _users_ f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: the line 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: unfortunately managerial decisions show every days that people fall into percentages. I'm pretty I just have to read Yahoo News right now pretty sure i'm just talking about language design here nothing else and in designing languages for the web, we should aim to cater for 100% of users, and n% of use cases, where n < 100. yes but people are ""humans"" not machines. When they read something, they charge it with emotions, etc. The same way you read leif comment with emotions. lachy: (that's the principle i was going to add) so when you say 80% of something, many people will think 20% of people if people aren't going to read what i write, that's not really my problem :-) at least not in this context :) unfortunately it is ;) or you have missed everything about social relationship :p not in this context -- if people are going to ignore what i write and argue against what they think i'm writing, then i'll just ignore them, as they aren't being productive. no big loss to me, since someone who doesn't slow down long enough to actually read what they're talking about probably isn't going to be slowing down long enough to think about what they're writing either. exactly! It's more productive to not respond in some cases and just hope that, eventually, people get the idea that unproductive, emotionally charged responses don't get responses, and then they stop sending them oh, nice, Jason White gave a usecase for <input usemap> yet he's ignoring that virtually *nobody* uses it for that purpose anyway ok, added Baby Steps to the principles that's quite well written why thank you hmm. I wonder if it's at all possible to search for sites that use <input type=image> as a server side image map as opposed to a button? i.e. those that care about the .x and .y coordinates? yes but there'd be a lot that use type=image, but don't care about x,y right i don't understand why people have such a gut reaction to us removing unused or abused features (like usemap) (on input) the philip in http://www.w3.org/mid/<email/> apparently missed the list of URIs that has been cited several times some people just seem to think the designers of HTML4 had more wisdom then we do, and think they must have included it for a good reason"
