# Geedka

## What is this?

Geedka is a basic language in which you can specify the structure of a moderation flow.
It is minimal, and intentionally as simple as possible.

The name *Geedka* comes from the Somali word for "tree".

## Geedka syntax

Geedka statements are one line (TODO: allow multiline and comments),
with a separate part per each section of a moderation flow node.

There are several kinds of supported nodes:

* Messages -- a simple message with text shown to the user
* Selections -- a dropdown with several options
* Switches -- a message with several buttons
* Yes/No -- a message with yes/no options (shorthand for a binary)
* User input boxes (modals) -- a popup that asks for user input

There are also several special features:
* Terminals -- the end of a reporting flow.
        This is manually implemented by the technical team.
        All reporting flows must end in a terminal
* Embeds -- these are specified within the description of a message.
* Data collection specifications --
        these allow you to specify whether a given selection or switch will lead to a divergence in the tree or merely to data collection.

## Geedka syntax

Note that the brackets are merely for ease of reading
-- they are not part of the language syntax.

Geedka is not sensitive to whitespace,
so you can indent however much or little you would like.
However, it is likely bad style to not indent.
Additionally, Geedka is sensitive to newlines --
multiline node specifications are on the TODO list but low priority.

Note that wherever a description or message is mentioned below,
it must be in the embed specification format.

The "tag" of a question is the name its entry in the ticket will have.

### Messages
`m|[your message here]`

### Selections
`s|[tag]|[data collect spec]|[selection description]`

`       option1|option2|` and so on

`               [node specification for child generated at option1] `
and so on

#### A note on options

The option names for a dropdown can be of two forms.
The simpler form is just a list of `|`-delimited words or phrases.
This will generate a dropdown with these words.
One can also provide a description for some or all of the options,
by following the label with a `\` and then providing the description.

Some examples:
* Just labels: `Huey|Dewey|Louie`
* Labels with descriptions: `Huey\Wears red|Dewey\Wears blue|Louie\Wears green`
* Mixed, some with descriptions and some without: `Mickey Mouse|Donald Duck|Barbossa\Technically a Disney character because Disney owns Pirates of the Caribbean`

### Switches
`w|[tag]|[data collect spec]|[switch description]`

`       option1|option2|` and so on

`               [node specification for child generated at option1] `
and so on


### Yes/No Selections
`y|[tag]|[data collect spec]|[question]`

Note that the options for a yes/no selection do not need to be enumerated,
so all of its children follow immediately after it.

### Input boxes (modals)
`i|[question]`

`       input box name1|input box name2|` and so on

Note that modals cannot be the first node in a Geedka moderation flow.

### Terminals
`t`

The actual effects of a terminal are manually programmed,
but for our purposes, you can assume they are given.

### Embed descriptions
I have intentionally provided as much flexibility as possible in embed specification,
so messages to users are flexible.

#### The simplest possible embed
`The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog`

No extra work and a pretty embed is shown with your message.

#### More complex embeds

Embeds may be separated in two ways:

First, the top-level separation, delimited by the `\` character.

`[field]\[field]\` and so on

Second, within each field, the name and value of a field must be split by the `^` character.

Therefore, for an embed with two fields, the specification would look as follows:

`Coincidence?^I do not think so\Mystery?^Maybe\Hotel?^Trivago.`

#### Titles

If a field is provided but is not split by `^` characters,
it is assumed to be a title. I have not checked to see what happens if you try to put multiple titles, but it's likely best if you don't.

### Data collect specs
There are two variants for data collect specs:
* `b`, meaning *branch*. This means there is a separate moderation flow following this question depending on the answer to it.
* `d`, meaning *data*. This means that the answer to the question is recorded and moderation flow continues all the same regardless of the answer.

### Ordering
The description file for Geedka should be ordered such that the children of a node
follow the description of a node in the order in which they should appear,
excepting the children of the children.

Leading or trailing whitespace does not matter, so it can be inserted to clarify relationships between nodes.

## An example

Suppose we want to represent the following moderation flow:

```
        +-----------------------------+
        | Let's play a guessing game. |
        +-----------------------------+
                       |
        +----------------------------+
        | What is my favorite color? |
        |          (switch)          |
        +----------------------------+
           |           |          |
       +-----+     +-------+  +------+
       | Red |     | Green |  | Blue |
       +-----+     +-------+  +------+
          /           |             \
         /            |              \
   +--------+   +----------+  +----------------------+
   | Wrong! |   | Correct! |  | Close, but no cigar. |
   +--------+   +----------+  +----------------------+
```

We would represent this in Geedka as follows:

```
m|      Let's play a guessing game
w|fav|b|What is my favorite color?
        Red | Green | Blue
        m|Wrong!
                t
        m|Correct!
                t
        m|Close, but no cigar.
                t
```

## How to use the Geedka tool

There are a small number of steps
that need to be carried out to use to the tool.
1. Once you have written a config file (it should be called `config.geedka`),
navigate to the `geedka` directory in terminal.
2. Then, run `make` to generate the necessary files.
3. Finally, run `make run` to run the program.

Additionally, you can run `make clean` to remove all the generated files.
